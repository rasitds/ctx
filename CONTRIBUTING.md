## Submitting Changes

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicating work
2. For large changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Read the specs in `specs/` to understand the design

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure tests pass: `go test ./...`
5. Ensure code compiles: `go build ./...`
6. Commit with a clear message (see below)
7. Push and open a pull request

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(cli): add ctx export command`
- `fix(drift): handle missing files gracefully`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

### Code Style

- Follow Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful variable names
- Handle errors explicitly
