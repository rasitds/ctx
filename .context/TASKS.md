# Tasks

<!--
STRUCTURE RULES (see CONSTITUTION.md):
- Tasks stay in their Phase section permanently — never move them
- Use inline labels: #in-progress, #blocked, #priority:high
- Mark completed: [x], skipped: [-] (with reason)
- Never delete tasks, never remove Phase headers

### Phase 1: Journal Site Improvements `#priority:high`

**Context**: Enriched journal files now have YAML frontmatter (topics, type, outcome,
technologies, key_files). The site generator should leverage this metadata for
better discovery and navigation.

- [x] Check for the latest backup of .context (there is a script in ~/WORKSPACE)
  and if it is >2days old, remind the user to run the backup script.
  we can use a hook for this. Alternative could be detecting this,
  exiting early, and using a cron job; but the disadvantage is, if nothing has
  changed, the cron job will still make a redundant backup: If nobody is using
  the project, then there is no need to run the backup anyway.
  **Done**: UserPromptSubmit hook (check-backup-age.sh) checks marker file age
  and SMB mount status. Backup script moved to hack/backup-context.sh with env
  vars (CTX_BACKUP_SMB_URL). All hook paths migrated to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR.
  `make backup` target added. #done:2026-02-05

- [x] Build minimal ctx monitor dashboard (see specs/monitor-architecture.md).
  - [x] MVP: a terminal script that runs in a separate window, finds the active
    session JSONL, estimates token usage, shows context health (green/yellow/red),
    and refreshes periodically. Later: pluggable auditors
    (drift, repetition detection), signal injection via hooks. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-04-223356
  **Rescoped**: Full dashboard deferred. Instead: check-context-size.sh hook
  with adaptive frequency + ctx-context-monitor skill for in-session awareness.
  context-watch.sh kept as-is for manual terminal monitoring. Repetition
  detection shelved (low ROI, user notices loops faster). #done:2026-02-05
  - [x] Deploy context-watch.sh to .context/tools/ via ctx init. Embedded in
    binary, deployed with 0755 permissions by createTools() in initialize.
    #done:2026-02-06

- [x] Search for a consolidation/code-hygiene skill that can enforce
  project-specific conventions. Today's codebase scan found concrete
  drift: 5 Is* predicate violations, magic strings in 7+ files, 80+ hardcoded
  file permissions. A skill that periodically checks for ctx's known drift
  patterns (godoc style, predicate naming, file organization, magic strings
  in config) would be the enforcement arm of CONVENTIONS.md. Look for skills
  focused on codebase consistency, convention enforcement, or technical debt
  scanning — not generic code review checklists. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-04-222224
  **Done**: Found generic skill (70% redundant per E/A/R), adapted to
  `/consolidate` with 9 project-specific checks. Added line width +
  duplication conventions. Blog post drafted. #completed:2026-02-05

**Features (priority order):**

- [ ] T1.1: Topics system
      - Single `/topics/index.md` page
      - Popular topics (2+ sessions) get dedicated pages (`/topics/{topic}.md`)
      - Long-tail topics (1 session) listed inline with direct session links
      - All on one page for Ctrl+F discoverability
      #added:2026-02-03

- [ ] T1.2: Key files index
      - Reverse lookup: file → sessions that touched it
      - Uses `key_files` from frontmatter (not parsed from conversation)
      - `/files/index.md` or similar
      #added:2026-02-03

- [ ] T1.3: Session type pages
      - Dedicated page per type: `/types/debugging.md`, `/types/feature.md`, etc.
      - Groups sessions by type (feature, bugfix, refactor, exploration, debugging, documentation)
      #added:2026-02-03

- [ ] T1.4: Investigate inconsistent tool output collapsing
      - Some files have collapsed tool outputs (`<details>`), others don't
      - Example with uncollapsed long outputs: `2026-02-03-sunny-stirring-pillow-7900d2dc`
      - Collapsing threshold is >10 lines per normalize skill spec
      - Unclear where the existing collapsing happens — may be in export, normalize, or site pipeline
      - Investigate why some pass through uncollapsed, fix the gap
      #added:2026-02-06

**Deferred:**
- [-] Timeline narrative — dropped, duplicates `/ctx-blog` skill (see DECISIONS.md)
- Outcome filtering (uncertain value, revisit after seeing data)
- Stats dashboard (skipped - gamification, low ROI)
- Technology index (skipped - not useful for this project)

**Design note**: Topics and key-files both need content search across journal
entries (not just filename matching). Consider FTS5 or similar full-text
indexing — grep across 100+ journal files won't scale.

**Design status**: Understanding confirmed, ready for design approaches.

### Phase 2: Export Preservation `#priority:medium`

- [ ] T2.1: `ctx recall export --update` mode
      - Preserve YAML frontmatter and summary when re-exporting
      - Update only the raw conversation content
      - Solves: `--force` loses enrichments, no-force can't update
      #added:2026-02-03

### Maintenance

- [ ] Investigate ctx init overwriting user-generated content in .context/ files. Commit a9df9dd wiped 18 decisions from DECISIONS.md, replacing with empty template. Need guard to prevent reinit from destroying user data (decisions, learnings, tasks). Consider: skip existing files, merge strategy, or --force-only overwrite. #added:2026-02-06-182205
- [ ] Add ctx help command; use-case-oriented cheat sheet for lazy CLI users. Should cover: (1) core CLI commands grouped by workflow (getting started, tracking decisions, browsing history, AI context), (2) available slash-command skills with one-line descriptions, (3) common workflow recipes showing how commands and skills combine. One screen, no scrolling. Not a skill; a real CLI command. #added:2026-02-06-184257
- [ ] Add topic-based navigation to blog when post count reaches 15+ #priority:low #added:2026-02-07-015054
- [ ] Run `/consolidate` to address codebase drift. Considerable drift has
      accumulated (predicate naming, magic strings, hardcoded permissions,
      godoc style). #priority:medium #added:2026-02-06
