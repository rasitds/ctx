# Tasks

<!--
STRUCTURE RULES (see CONSTITUTION.md):
- Tasks stay in their Phase section permanently — never move them
- Use inline labels: #in-progress, #blocked, #priority:high
- Mark completed: [x], skipped: [-] (with reason)
- Never delete tasks, never remove Phase headers
-->

### Phase 0: Ideas

**Extractable Patterns** (from `ideas/REPORT-1-extractable-patterns.md`):
Analysis of 69 sessions found 8 recurring workflow patterns. 
7 have automation gaps worth addressing.

- [x] Create a Skills Reference page (docs/skills.md): standalone page listing 
  all ctx-shipped skills with name, one-liner description, and link to the recipe 
  or doc page that covers it in depth. Analogous to cli-reference.md but for 
  slash commands. Scope: ctx-bundled skills only
  (shipped via internal/assets/claude/skills/); project-specific skills are out of 
  scope. Should include: skill name, description, when to use, key commands it 
  wraps, and cross-links to recipes where the skill appears. 
  #priority:medium #added:2026-02-14-125604

- [x] Blog: "Parallel Agents with Git Worktrees" — how to use worktrees
      with ctx to tackle large task backlogs. Narrative: 30 open tasks,
      grouping by file overlap, spawning parallel agents, merging results.
      Practical guide with the ctx project as the example. Connects to the
      agent-team-strategies report (REPORT-8). #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-12 #done:2026-02-14

- [x] "Borrow from the future" merge skill: given two folders of the same
      project (a "present" and a "future" copy), extract and apply the delta.
      Use case: parallel worktree or separate checkout where commits can't
      be pushed/pulled normally. Strategy ladder:
      (1) Both are git repos → compare commit histories, cherry-pick or
          generate patch series (`git format-patch` / `git am`)
      (2) Only one is a git repo → export the non-git side to a temp git
          repo, diff against the other, produce a patch
      (3) Neither is git → recursive diff, present changes for selective
          application
      Should handle: file additions, deletions, renames, binary files.
      Should warn: conflicting changes in both copies. Could be a skill
      (`/ctx-borrow`) or a standalone `ctx borrow --from ../ctx-future`
      CLI command. #priority:low #added:2026-02-12 #done:2026-02-14
      Done: Implemented as `/ctx-borrow` skill in `.claude/skills/ctx-borrow/SKILL.md`.
      Covers all 3 strategy tiers, conflict detection, dry-run, and selective apply.

**Documentation Drift** (from `ideas/REPORT-2-documentation-drift.md`):
Overall drift severity LOW. 14 existing doc.go files are accurate. Key gaps below.

**Maintainability** (from `ideas/REPORT-3-maintainability.md`):
Score 7.5/10. Strong structural discipline. Key refactoring opportunities below.

**Security** (from `ideas/REPORT-4-security.md`):
Overall risk LOW. No critical/high findings. 3 medium, 5 low.

- [x] M-1: Add path boundary validation on `--context-dir` / `CTX_DIR`.
      No guard prevents operations outside project root. In AI-agent
      context with auto-approved commands, a prompt-injected agent could
      write to sensitive locations. Add optional boundary check with
      `--allow-outside-cwd` escape hatch. #priority:medium #source:report-4
      Done: `ValidateBoundary()` + `CheckSymlinks()` in internal/validation/path.go,
      enforced globally in PersistentPreRun. Tests in path_test.go.

- [x] M-2: Add symlink detection before file read/write in `.context/`.
      No `Lstat()` or `EvalSymlinks()` calls anywhere. A malicious
      `.context/` with symlinks could cause reads/writes outside project
      boundary. #priority:medium #source:report-4
      Done: `CheckSymlinks()` in internal/validation/path.go uses
      `Lstat()` on dir + children. Called from context/loader.go:48.
      Tests in path_test.go.

- [x] M-3: Use secure temp file patterns for cooldown tombstones and
      counter files. Predictable `/tmp/ctx-*` paths with `$PPID` are
      vulnerable to symlink race. Use `os.CreateTemp()` or user-specific
      subdirectory. #priority:low #source:report-4
      Done: `secureTempDir()` in internal/cli/agent/cooldown.go uses
      $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ctx or os.TempDir()/ctx-<uid> (0700). Files 0600.

- [x] L-3: Fix prompt-coach.sh session tracking: uses `$$` (hook PID)
      instead of session ID, so counter state never persists across
      prompts. Rate limiting is broken. #priority:low #source:report-4
      Skipped: moot — prompt-coach hook removed entirely.

**Blog Themes** (from `ideas/REPORT-5-blog-themes.md`):
8 post proposals with narrative sequencing. See report for full details.

**Improvements** (from `ideas/done/REPORT-6-improvements.md`):
21 opportunities across 7 categories. Key items not already tracked elsewhere:

- [x] Align ctx recall list docs with CLI reality #priority:high #added:2026-02-15-191942

- [x] ~~Add drift check: verify .claude/hooks/*.sh files have execute permission~~ Moot: hooks are now Go subcommands (v0.6.0 plugin conversion) #priority:medium #added:2026-02-15-194829 #done:2026-02-16

- [x] Add binary/plugin version drift detection hook. A session-start or PreToolUse hook that runs ctx --version, compares the binary semver against the plugin's expected minimum version, and emits a warning if mismatched (e.g. 'Your ctx binary is v0.5.x but this plugin expects v0.6.x — reinstall the binary to get the best out of ctx'). Use an existing hook warning pattern. The plugin cannot and should not auto-install the binary (requires sudo). #priority:medium #added:2026-02-16-155633 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: `ctx system check-version` hook — compares `config.BinaryVersion` (ldflags)
      against embedded `plugin.json` version. Daily throttle, skips dev builds.
      Registered in system.go, added to hooks.json under UserPromptSubmit.

- [x] Rename journal slugs to title-based filenames #priority:medium #added:2026-02-16-141643 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Title-based slugs (enriched title > FirstUserMsg > Claude slug > short ID),
      session_id in YAML frontmatter, dedup via session index with rename-on-re-export.

- [ ] Blog: "Building a Claude Code Marketplace Plugin" — narrative from session history, journals, and git diff of feat/plugin-conversion branch. Covers: motivation (shell hooks to Go subcommands), plugin directory layout, marketplace.json, eliminating make plugin, bugs found during dogfooding (hooks creating partial .context/), and the fix. Use /ctx-blog-changelog with branch diff as source material. #added:2026-02-16-111948

- [x] ctx init should distinguish partial .context/ (only logs) from fully initialized. Check for essential files (TASKS.md, CONSTITUTION.md) instead of just directory existence. #added:2026-02-16-110811 #done:2026-02-16

- [x] Hooks should no-op when .context/ is not properly initialized (missing essential files). Currently hooks create .context/logs/ as side effect before ctx init, then ctx init thinks the dir is already initialized. #added:2026-02-16-110721 #done:2026-02-16

- [x] Rename internal/tpl to internal/assets -- the package now holds both .context/ templates and the Claude Code plugin (skills, hooks, manifest). "tpl" is misleading. Mechanical refactor: rename dir, update all ~15 import sites, update embed.go package doc. Low priority, no behavior change. #added:2026-02-16-104745 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Renamed dir, updated package declaration, 10 Go import sites,
      17 doc/context/skill/config files, glossary entry. Historical specs/ untouched.

- [x] Align ctx recall list CLI output with docs: columnar table format with aligned headers (Slug, Project, Date, Duration, Turns, Tokens) #priority:high #added:2026-02-15-192053 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Replaced multi-line per-session format with single-row columnar
      table. Dynamic slug/project widths, truncate helper for long slugs.

- [x] Increase recall test coverage from 8.8% to 50%+. Core user-facing
      feature with near-zero safety net. Session format has already
      changed once. #priority:high #source:report-6 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: 84.0% coverage. All new slug/index/dedup functions at 87-100%.

- [-] CI coverage enforcement: extend `test-coverage` Makefile target
      beyond just `internal/context` to enforce project-wide and
      per-package minimums. #priority:medium #source:report-6
      Skipped: Replaced with HTML coverage report task below.

- [x] HTML coverage report: generate browsable HTML coverage output
      (go tool cover -html) and optionally publish to the docs site.
      Add as part of a `make audit` target that runs vet, test, and
      coverage in one pass for pre-commit checks. #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Replaced `make test-cover` (was duplicate of `test`) with
      HTML report generation → dist/coverage.html.

- [x] Shell completion enrichment: add subcommand argument completions
      (e.g., `ctx add task|decision|learning|convention`). Cobra supports
      this natively. #priority:low #source:report-6 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: ValidArgs on `ctx add` for entry types, RegisterFlagCompletionFunc
      on --priority for high/medium/low. Both with ShellCompDirectiveNoFileComp.

- [ ] MCP server integration: expose context as tools/resources via Model
      Context Protocol. Would enable deep integration with any
      MCP-compatible client. #priority:low #source:report-6

**User-Facing Documentation** (from `ideas/done/REPORT-7-documentation.md`):
Docs are feature-organized, not problem-organized. Key structural improvements:

- [x] Create use-case page: "I Keep Re-Explaining My Codebase" -- the #1
      pain point driving adoption. Lead with the problem, show ctx
      solution, before/after comparison. #priority:high #source:report-7 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: docs/re-explaining.md — pain-point landing page with problem statement,
      before/after comparison, mechanism overview, and 5-minute try-it path.

- [x] Create use-case page: "Is ctx Right for My Project?" -- decision
      framework for evaluation, good fit vs not right fit,
      try-in-5-minutes. #priority:high #source:report-7 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: docs/is-ctx-right.md — good fit/not right fit checklists, project size
      guide, zero-commitment 5-minute trial, links to Getting Started and Comparison.

- [x] Expand Getting Started with guided first-session walkthrough showing
      full interaction end-to-end (what user types, what ctx outputs,
      what AI says back). #priority:medium #source:report-7 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Already covered by docs/first-session.md — 5-step walkthrough
      with exact commands, outputs, and AI response.

- [x] Reorder site navigation: promote Prompting Guide and Context Files
      higher, demote Session Journal and Autonomous Loops. Current order
      front-loads advanced features. #priority:medium #source:report-7 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Nav has been significantly restructured since this was filed.
      Context Files and Prompting Guide are in Home. Session Journal is in
      Reference, Autonomous Loops in Recipes. Current order is a natural
      funnel from problem → setup → daily use → reference.

- [x] Cross-reference blog posts from documentation pages via "Further
      Reading" sections (6 specific link suggestions in
      report). #priority:low #source:report-7 #done:2026-02-14
      Done: Added "Further Reading" to autonomous-loop, prompting-guide,
      integrations, context-files, and comparison pages.

- [-] Create migration/adoption guide for existing projects: how ctx
      interacts with existing CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, the --merge
      flag in workflow context. #priority:medium #source:report-7
      Skipped: No migration needed — ctx is additive markdown files.
      Coexistence with CLAUDE.md/.cursorrules already covered in
      Getting Started and Integrations.

- [-] Create troubleshooting page: consolidate scattered troubleshooting
      into one page (ctx not in PATH, hooks not firing, context not
      loading). #priority:low #source:report-7
      Skipped: Not enough content to warrant a page. The few troubleshooting
      items are already inline where they belong (Integrations, Autonomous Loop).

- [ ] Investigate why this PR is closed, is there anything we can leverage
      from it: https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/pull/17

- [ ] Use-case page: "My AI Keeps Making the Same Mistakes" — problem-first
      page showcasing DECISIONS.md and CONSTITUTION.md. Partially covered in
      about.md but deserves standalone treatment as the #2 pain point.
      #priority:medium #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17

- [ ] Use-case page: "Joining a ctx Project" — team onboarding guide. What
      to read first, how to check context health, starting your first session,
      adding context, session etiquette, common pitfalls. Currently
      undocumented. #priority:medium #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17

- [ ] Use-case page: "Keeping AI Honest" — unique ctx differentiator.
      Covers confabulation problem, grounded memory via context files,
      anti-hallucination rules in AGENT_PLAYBOOK, verification loop,
      ctx drift for detecting stale context. #priority:medium
      #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17

- [ ] Expand comparison page with specific tool comparisons: .cursorrules,
      Aider --read, Copilot @workspace, Cline memory, Windsurf rules.
      Current page positions against categories but not the specific tools
      users are evaluating. #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17

- [ ] FAQ page: collect answers to common questions currently scattered
      across docs — Why markdown? Does it work offline? What gets committed?
      How big should my token budget be? Why not a database?
      #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17

- [ ] Enhance security page for team workflows: code review for .context/
      files, gitignore patterns, team conventions for context management,
      multi-developer sharing. #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17

- [ ] Version history changelog summaries: each version entry should have
      2-3 bullet points describing key changes, not just a link to the
      source tree. #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17

**Agent Team Strategies** (from `ideas/REPORT-8-agent-teams.md`):
8 team compositions proposed. Reference material, not tasks. Key takeaways:

- [ ] Document agent team recipes in `hack/` or `.context/`: team
      compositions for feature dev (3 agents), consolidation sprint
      (3-4 agents), release prep (2 agents), doc sprint (3 agents).
      Include coordination patterns and anti-patterns. #priority:low #source:report-8

### PR Review: VS Code/Copilot Integration (GH-16) `#priority:high`

**Context**: PR #16 by @bilersan adds VS Code/Copilot support — a Markdown
session parser, `ctx hook copilot --write`, and a VS Code chat participant
extension. 7993 additions, touches recall parser, hook, init, and config.
https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/pull/16

- [x] PR-16.1: Baseline — verify current parser behavior is intact.
      Run full journal pipeline (export → normalize → enrich → site build)
      on main branch BEFORE applying PR changes. Back up the resulting
      journal-site output as the baseline artifact.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: 250 entries, 289 markdown files captured to /tmp/pr16-baseline/.

- [x] PR-16.2: Apply PR changes and re-run the full journal pipeline
      (export → normalize → enrich → site build) with the proposed code.
      Visually inspect the journal website for rendering issues, missing
      entries, or format changes.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: All tests pass (4.064s parser pkg). 250 entries, 289 files.

- [x] PR-16.3: Semantic diff — compare baseline journal output against
      PR journal output. Check for: missing sessions, changed turn
      attribution (human vs assistant), lost metadata, format differences
      in exported Markdown. Any discrepancy in existing Claude Code
      sessions is a regression.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Zero diff — normalized md5sum manifests are byte-identical.

- [x] PR-16.4: Code quality review. Assess:
      (a) Does MarkdownSessionParser respect the existing parser interface
          (`parser.go`, `parse.go`)? (b) Are the hook/init changes backward
          compatible? (c) Does `config/dir.go` and `config/file.go` follow
          existing constant naming conventions? (d) Test coverage — are the
          390 lines of parser tests sufficient for edge cases? (e) Does the
          VS Code extension follow reasonable practices (bundling, security,
          error handling)? (f) Are there any concerns about the `.context/sessions/`
          directory creation in init (given the journal consolidation)?
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Approve with 4 minor suggestions (see follow-up tasks below).
      Parser interface compliance: pass. Backward compat: confirmed by PR-16.3.
      Naming: consistent. Tests: solid (391 Go + 185 TS lines). VS Code: good
      practices (cancellation, config, bundling). Sessions dir: appropriate.

- [x] PR-16.5: Post-review — leave structured feedback on the PR with
      findings from PR-16.1 through PR-16.4. Approve, request changes,
      or comment based on results.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Structured review posted, PR approved on GitHub.

**Follow-up suggestions from PR-16 review** (non-blocking, post-merge):

- [x] PR-16-S1: Fix map iteration non-determinism in `markdown.go:185`.
      `extractSections` returns `map[string]string`; `parseMarkdownSession`
      iterates it to build `bodyParts`, producing non-deterministic section
      order in the assistant message. Sort keys or use an ordered slice.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Changed `extractSections` to return `[]section` (ordered slice)
      preserving document order. Updated caller and test.

- [x] PR-16-S2: Add `--no-color` to VS Code extension's `handleAgent` and
      `handleLoad` handlers for consistency with all other handlers.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Added `"--no-color"` to both `runCtx` calls in extension.ts.

- [x] PR-16-S3: Guard against session double-counting in `query.go`.
      If `.context/sessions/` is passed as both CWD-relative (auto-scan)
      and as an `additionalDirs` argument, sessions could appear twice.
      Add a seen-paths set or dedup by session ID.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Added `scanOnce` helper with `scannedDirs` set using
      `filepath.EvalSymlinks` for path normalization. Directory-level
      dedup complements existing session-ID dedup.

- [x] PR-16-S4: Make `--write` optional in VS Code extension's `handleHook`.
      Currently always passes `--write`, so users can't preview hook output
      via chat. Consider a dry-run mode or separate preview command.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Parse prompt for `preview`/`--preview` keyword. Default
      behavior unchanged (writes). `@ctx /hook copilot preview` shows
      output without writing files.

### Phase 3: Encrypted Scratchpad (`ctx pad`) `#priority:high`

**Context**: Secure one-liner scratchpad, encrypted at rest, synced via git.
AES-256-GCM with symmetric key (gitignored). Plaintext fallback via config.
Spec: `specs/scratchpad.md`

**Features:**

- [x] P3.21: `ctx pad import FILE` — bulk-import lines from a file into
      the scratchpad. Each non-empty line becomes a separate entry. Supports
      stdin via `-`. Single write cycle. Spec: `specs/pad-import.md`
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `internal/cli/pad/import.go` — 83 lines, 8 tests. Docs updated.

- [x] P3.22: `ctx pad export [DIR]` — export all blob entries to a directory
      as files. Label becomes filename, timestamp prefix on collision,
      --force to overwrite, --dry-run to preview. Counterpart to pad import.
      Replaces fragile bash script (hack/pad-export-blobs.sh).
      Spec: `specs/pad-export.md` #priority:medium #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `internal/cli/pad/export.go` — 114 lines, 10 tests. Docs updated.

- [x] P3.23: `ctx pad merge FILE...` — merge entries from one or more
      scratchpad files into the current pad. Auto-detects encrypted vs
      plaintext inputs (try-decrypt-first). Content-based deduplication
      (position/line number irrelevant). `--key` for foreign encrypted files,
      `--dry-run` for preview. Warns on same-label-different-data blobs and
      non-UTF-8 content in plaintext fallback.
      Spec: `specs/pad-merge.md` #priority:medium #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `internal/cli/pad/merge.go` — 265 lines, 19 tests. All pass.

  - [x] P3.23a: Implement `readFileEntries()` helper — reads a file, tries
        decryption with available key, falls back to plaintext. Returns
        parsed entries. #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19

  - [x] P3.23b: Implement `runMerge()` and `mergeCmd()` — core merge logic
        with dedup, blob conflict detection, dry-run, and output formatting.
        Register in `pad.go`. #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19

  - [x] P3.23c: Tests for merge — 19 test cases covering: basic merge,
        all-duplicates, empty input, multiple files, encrypted input,
        plaintext fallback, mixed formats, dry-run, custom key, blobs,
        blob conflicts, binary warning, file not found, empty pad, plaintext
        mode, order preservation, cross-file dedup, encrypted blob dedup,
        pluralize. #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19

  - [x] P3.23d: Update pad command long description in `pad.go` to list
        `merge` subcommand. #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19

  - [x] P3.23e: Add `pad merge` to user-facing docs: scratchpad.md (commands
        table, usage section, skill table), cli-reference.md (reference entry),
        recipes/scratchpad-sync.md (merge as preferred conflict resolution,
        commands table, conversational example). #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19

**Documentation:**

- [x] P3.19: Update Getting Started / Quick Start to mention scratchpad
      as part of `ctx init` output. #priority:low #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Added scratchpad mention to Getting Started init section.

- [x] P3.20: Update `ctx help` (when it exists) to include `pad` command.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: `pad` already appears in `ctx --help` via Cobra registration.

### Phase 4: Obsidian Vault Export (`ctx journal obsidian`) `#priority:high`

**Context**: Export enriched journal entries as an Obsidian vault with wikilinks,
MOC pages, and graph-optimized cross-linking. Reuses existing journal scan/parse/index
infrastructure with an Obsidian-specific output layer.
Spec: `specs/journal-obsidian.md`

- [x] P4.0: Read `specs/journal-obsidian.md` before starting any P4 task.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

- [x] P4.1: Add Obsidian constants to `internal/config/`
      New constants: `ObsidianDirName`, `ObsidianDirEntries`, `ObsidianConfigDir`,
      `ObsidianAppConfig`, MOC filenames, `ObsidianMOCPrefix`. Follow existing
      `Journal*` constant naming pattern.
      Done: `internal/config/obsidian.go` — 3 const blocks covering dirs,
      config, MOC filenames, format templates, and README.

- [x] P4.2: Implement wikilink conversion (`wikilink.go`)
      - `convertMarkdownLinks(content string) string` — regex-based markdown
        link → wikilink conversion. Skip external URLs. Strip `.md` extension
        and path prefixes from targets.
      - `formatWikilink(target, display string) string` — format `[[target|display]]`
      - Unit tests in `wikilink_test.go`
      Done: 11 test cases covering internal, external, multipart, mixed links.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

- [x] P4.3: Implement frontmatter transformation (`frontmatter.go`)
      - `transformFrontmatter(content string) string` — rename `topics` → `tags`,
        add `aliases` from title, add `source_file` field. Preserve all other
        fields. Parse and re-emit YAML frontmatter.
      - Unit tests for frontmatter transformation
      Done: `frontmatter.go` + `frontmatter_test.go` with 8 test cases.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

- [x] P4.4: Implement MOC page generation (`moc.go`)
      - `generateHomeMOC(entries, topics, keyFiles, sessionTypes)` — root hub
      - `generateObsidianTopicsMOC(topics)` — topics index with wikilinks
      - `generateObsidianTopicPage(topic)` — individual topic page
      - `generateObsidianFilesMOC(keyFiles)` — files index with wikilinks
      - `generateObsidianFilePage(kf)` — individual file page
      - `generateObsidianTypesMOC(types)` — types index with wikilinks
      - `generateObsidianTypePage(st)` — individual type page
      - All use wikilinks, grouped by month, same threshold logic as site
      Done: All 7 generators + `generateObsidianGroupedPage` helper.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

- [x] P4.5: Implement related sessions footer (`moc.go`)
      - `generateRelatedFooter(entry, topicIndex)` — append topic/type links
        and "see also" entries sharing topics. Creates bidirectional graph edges.
      Done: `generateRelatedFooter` + `collectRelated` with score-based
      prioritization. Lives in `moc.go` alongside MOC generators.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

- [x] P4.6: Implement vault orchestration (`vault.go`)
      - `runJournalObsidian(cmd, output)` → `buildObsidianVault(cmd, journalDir, output)`
        1. Scan entries (reuse `scanJournalEntries`)
        2. Create output dirs (`entries/`, `topics/`, `files/`, `types/`, `.obsidian/`)
        3. Write `.obsidian/app.json`
        4. Transform and write entries (normalize, convert links, transform
           frontmatter, add related footer)
        5. Build indices (reuse `buildTopicIndex` etc.)
        6. Generate and write MOC pages
        7. Generate and write Home.md
      - Normalize content but do NOT write back to source files
      Done: Full pipeline with extracted `buildObsidianVault` for testability.
      Filter helpers: `filterRegularEntries`, `filterEntriesWithTopics`,
      `filterEntriesWithKeyFiles`, `filterEntriesWithType`, `buildTopicLookup`.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

- [x] P4.7: Add Cobra command (`obsidian.go`)
      - `journalObsidianCmd()` — register under `ctx journal obsidian`
        with `--output` flag (default `.context/journal-obsidian/`)
      - Wire into `journal.go` command tree
      Done: `obsidian.go` + updated `journal.go` to add command.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

- [x] P4.8: Integration test
      - Test fixtures with sample enriched entries
      - Run full pipeline, verify: vault structure, wikilink format in entries,
        MOC pages contain wikilinks, `.obsidian/app.json` exists, frontmatter
        has `tags` not `topics`
      Done: `vault_test.go` with 12 test functions — unit tests for all
      generators, filter helpers, related footer, and a full integration test
      with 3 sample entries verifying vault structure end-to-end.
      #added:2026-02-14-150803 #done:2026-02-14-152520

### Phase 1: Journal Site Improvements `#priority:high`

**Context**: Enriched journal files now have YAML frontmatter (topics, type, outcome,
technologies, key_files). The site generator should leverage this metadata for
better discovery and navigation.

**Features (priority order):**

- [x] T1.1: Topics system
      - Single `/topics/index.md` page
      - Popular topics (2+ sessions) get dedicated pages (`/topics/{topic}.md`)
      - Long-tail topics (1 session) listed inline with direct session links
      - All on one page for Ctrl+F discoverability
      #added:2026-02-03
      Done: `index.go` — `buildTopicIndex`, `generateTopicsIndex`, `generateTopicPage`.
      Wired in `run.go`. Tests in `journal_test.go`.

- [x] T1.2: Key files index
      - Reverse lookup: file → sessions that touched it
      - Uses `key_files` from frontmatter (not parsed from conversation)
      - `/files/index.md` or similar
      #added:2026-02-03
      Done: `index.go` — `buildKeyFileIndex`, `generateKeyFilesIndex`, `generateKeyFilePage`.
      Wired in `run.go`.

- [x] T1.3: Session type pages
      - Dedicated page per type: `/types/debugging.md`, `/types/feature.md`, etc.
      - Groups sessions by type (feature, bugfix, refactor, exploration, debugging, documentation)
      #added:2026-02-03
      Done: `index.go` — `buildTypeIndex`, `generateTypesIndex`, `generateTypePage`.
      Wired in `run.go`.

- [ ] T1.4: Investigate inconsistent tool output collapsing
      - Some files have collapsed tool outputs (`<details>`), others don't
      - Example with uncollapsed long outputs: `2026-02-03-sunny-stirring-pillow-7900d2dc`
      - Collapsing threshold is >10 lines per normalize skill spec
      - Unclear where the existing collapsing happens — may be in export, normalize, or site pipeline
      - Investigate why some pass through uncollapsed, fix the gap
      #added:2026-02-06

**Deferred:**
- [-] Timeline narrative — dropped, duplicates `/ctx-blog` skill (see DECISIONS.md)
- Outcome filtering (uncertain value, revisit after seeing data)
- Stats dashboard (skipped - gamification, low ROI)
- Technology index (skipped - not useful for this project)

**Design note**: Topics and key-files both need content search across journal
entries (not just filename matching). Consider FTS5 or similar full-text
indexing — grep across 100+ journal files won't scale.

**Design status**: Understanding confirmed, ready for design approaches.

### Phase 5: Knowledge Scaling `#priority:medium`

**Context**: DECISIONS.md and LEARNINGS.md grow monotonically with no archival path.
Tasks have `ctx tasks archive` / `ctx compact --archive`, but decisions and learnings
accumulate forever. Long-lived projects will hit token budget pressure and
signal-to-noise decay. Spec: `specs/knowledge-scaling.md`

- [ ] P5.1: Extract reusable entry parser for decisions and learnings. The
      archive commands need to parse entries, filter by date, and write back.
      Reuse existing reindex parsing logic where possible.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P5.2: `ctx decisions archive` command — move entries older than N days
      to `.context/archive/decisions-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Flags: `--days` (default
      90), `--dry-run`, `--all`, `--keep`. Rebuild index after archival.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P5.3: `ctx learnings archive` command — same pattern as P5.2 but for
      learnings. Write to `.context/archive/learnings-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P5.4: Extend `ctx compact --archive` to include decisions and learnings
      alongside existing task archival. Same age threshold.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P5.5: Superseded entry convention — document `~~Superseded by [...]~~`
      marker for decisions. `compact --archive` archives superseded entries
      regardless of age. Add to CONVENTIONS.md.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P5.6: `.contextrc` configuration — `archive_knowledge_after_days` (default
      90) and `archive_keep_recent` (default 5). Wire into archive commands and
      compact.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P5.7: Documentation — update cli-reference.md, context-files.md,
      recipes/context-health.md. Update `/consolidate` skill to suggest
      archival when files are large.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-18

### Phase 6: Session Ceremonies `#priority:medium`

**Context**: Sessions have two bookend rituals — init (`/ctx-remember`) and
wrap-up (`/ctx-wrap-up`). Unlike other ctx skills that encourage conversational
use, these should be explicitly invoked as slash commands for precision and
completeness. `/ctx-remember` already exists; `/ctx-wrap-up` is new.
Spec: `specs/session-wrap-up.md`

- [ ] P6.1: Create `/ctx-wrap-up` skill file at
      `.claude/skills/ctx-wrap-up/SKILL.md`. Skill should: gather signal
      (git diff, git log, conversation themes), propose candidates grouped
      by type, persist approved candidates via `ctx add`, optionally offer
      `/ctx-commit`. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P6.2: Update `check-persistence` hook to suggest `/ctx-wrap-up`
      instead of generic persistence advice.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P6.3: Create `docs/recipes/session-ceremonies.md` recipe — covers the
      two bookend skills as explicit rituals. Why explicit invocation (not
      conversational) for these two. Session start: `/ctx-remember`. Session
      end: `/ctx-wrap-up`. Quick reference card. When to skip.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P6.4: Update docs to reflect ceremony pattern — add "Session
      Ceremonies" grouping in docs/skills.md, cross-link from
      recipes/session-lifecycle.md, add callout in docs/prompting-guide.md
      distinguishing ceremony skills (explicit) from workflow skills
      (conversational), mention `/ctx-remember` in docs/first-session.md
      as recommended session start.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P6.5: `ctx system check-ceremonies` hook — scans recent journal
      entries for `/ctx-remember` and `/ctx-wrap-up` usage. If missing from
      last 3 sessions, emits a VERBATIM relay nudge explaining the benefit.
      Journal-first detection (cheap string scan); if journals are stale or
      missing, nudge user to export journals instead of falling back to
      JSONL (avoids expensive large-file scanning that eats context budget).
      Daily throttle, self-silencing when habits form.
      Spec: `specs/ceremony-nudge.md`
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P6.6: Register `check-ceremonies` in hooks.json under
      UserPromptSubmit. Add to `system.go` command tree. Update doc.go
      package comment.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

- [ ] P6.7: Tests for check-ceremonies — unit tests for journal scanning,
      throttling, output variants (both missing, one missing, neither).
      Integration test with sample journal directory.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-18

### Phase 7: Smart Retrieval `#priority:high`

**Context**: `ctx agent --budget` is cosmetic — the budget value is displayed
but never used for content selection. LEARNINGS.md is entirely excluded.
Decisions are title-only. No relevance filtering. This is the highest-impact
improvement for agent context quality. Spec: `specs/smart-retrieval.md`
Ref: https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/issues/19 (Phase 1)

- [x] P7.0: Read `specs/smart-retrieval.md` before starting any P7 task.
      #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19

- [x] P7.1: Add `score.go` — entry scoring functions. Recency scoring by
      age bracket (7d/30d/90d/90d+), task keyword extraction (stop words,
      dedup), relevance scoring by keyword overlap, superseded penalty.
      Tests in `score_test.go`.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `score.go` (165 lines) + `score_test.go` (185 lines), 12 test cases.

- [x] P7.2: Add `budget.go` — budget allocation and section assembly.
      Tier-based allocation: constitution/readorder/instruction (always),
      tasks (40%), conventions (20%), decisions+learnings (remaining).
      Graceful degradation: full entries → title summaries → drop.
      Tests in `budget_test.go`.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `budget.go` (290 lines) + `budget_test.go` (210 lines), 12 test cases.

- [x] P7.3: Update `extract.go` — add `extractDecisionBlocks`,
      `extractLearningBlocks`, `extractTaskKeywords`. Use
      `index.ParseEntryBlocks` for parsing, return `ScoredEntry` slices.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `extractAllConventions`, `parseEntryBlocks` in budget.go.
      `extractTaskKeywords` in score.go. Reuses `index.ParseEntryBlocks`.

- [x] P7.4: Update `types.go` — add `Learnings` and `Summaries` fields
      to `Packet`. Add `ScoredEntry` and `SectionBudget` types.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `ScoredEntry` in score.go. `Learnings` and `Summaries` fields
      added to `Packet` (omitempty for backward compat).

- [x] P7.5: Update `out.go` — replace hardcoded assembly with budget-aware
      assembly. Both Markdown and JSON output use the new budget system.
      Learnings section, decision bodies, "Also noted:" summaries.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `out.go` now delegates to `assembleBudgetPacket` + `renderMarkdownPacket`.

- [x] P7.6: Update existing agent tests to reflect new output format.
      Add integration test with fixture `.context/` containing large
      DECISIONS.md and LEARNINGS.md, verify budget is respected.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Existing TestAgentCommand and TestAgentJSONOutput pass. 28 total tests.

- [x] P7.7: Manual verification — run `ctx agent --budget 4000` and
      `ctx agent --budget 8000` on real project, verify output quality
      and budget compliance.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Tested at budgets 2000, 4000, 8000. Graceful degradation confirmed.
      JSON output includes new learnings/summaries fields.

### Phase 8: Drift Nudges `#priority:high`

**Context**: Context files grow without feedback. A project with 47 learnings
gets the same `ctx drift` output as one with 5. Entry count warnings nudge
users to consolidate or archive. Spec: `specs/drift-nudges.md`
Ref: https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/issues/19 (Phase 2)

- [x] P8.0: Read `specs/drift-nudges.md` before starting any P8 task.
      #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19

- [x] P8.1: Add `IssueEntryCount` and `CheckEntryCount` to
      `internal/drift/types.go`. Follow existing naming pattern.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Two new constants in types.go.

- [x] P8.2: Add `EntryCountLearnings` and `EntryCountDecisions` fields to
      `internal/rc/types.go`. Add defaults (30/20) to `internal/rc/default.go`.
      Add accessor functions to `internal/rc/rc.go`.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Fields in CtxRC, defaults 30/20, two accessor functions.

- [x] P8.3: Implement `checkEntryCount` in `internal/drift/detector.go`.
      Count entries using `index.ParseEntryBlocks`, compare to rc thresholds.
      Warning format: "has N entries (recommended: ≤M)".
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `checkEntryCount` function, wired into `Detect()`.

- [x] P8.4: Tests for `checkEntryCount` in `internal/drift/detector_test.go`.
      Cases: 0 entries, at threshold, above threshold, disabled (0), custom
      threshold, both files above, file missing.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: `TestCheckEntryCount` (7 cases) + `TestCheckEntryCountDisabled`.

- [x] P8.5: Run full test suite, verify no regressions.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: All 34 packages pass. Real project shows LEARNINGS 81/30, DECISIONS 35/20.

- [x] P8.6: Update docs — cli-reference.md (drift section), context-files.md
      if relevant. #priority:low #added:2026-02-19 #done:2026-02-19
      Done: Added entry count check to cli-reference.md drift section with
      .contextrc configuration example.

### Phase 9: Context Consolidation Skill `#priority:medium`

**Context**: `/ctx-consolidate` skill that groups overlapping entries by keyword
similarity and merges them with user approval. Originals archived, not deleted.
Spec: `specs/context-consolidation.md`
Ref: https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/issues/19 (Phase 3)

- [ ] P9.1: Create `.claude/skills/ctx-consolidate/SKILL.md` — full skill
      prompt covering: entry parsing, keyword-based grouping, candidate
      presentation, user approval, merge execution, archival, reindex.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-19

- [ ] P9.2: Test manually on this project's LEARNINGS.md (20+ entries).
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-19

- [ ] P9.3: Update docs/skills.md and docs/cli-reference.md with the new skill.
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-19

### Phase 2: Export Preservation `#priority:medium`

- [ ] T2.1: `ctx recall export --update` mode
      - Preserve YAML frontmatter and summary when re-exporting
      - Update only the raw conversation content
      - Solves: `--force` loses enrichments, no-force can't update
      #added:2026-02-03

### Maintenance

- [ ] Recipes section needs human review. For example, certain workflows can
  be autonomously done by asking AI "can you record our learnings?" but
  from the documenation it's not clear. Spend as much time as necessary
  on every single recipe.

- [ ] Investigate ctx init overwriting user-generated content in .context/ 
      files. Commit a9df9dd wiped 18 decisions from DECISIONS.md, replacing with 
      empty template. Need guard to prevent reinit from destroying user data 
     (decisions, learnings, tasks). Consider: skip existing files, merge strategy, 
      or --force-only overwrite. #added:2026-02-06-182205
- [ ] Add ctx help command; use-case-oriented cheat sheet for lazy CLI users. 
      Should cover: (1) core CLI commands grouped by workflow (getting started, tracking decisions, browsing history, AI context), (2) available slash-command skills with one-line descriptions, (3) common workflow recipes showing how commands and skills combine. One screen, no scrolling. Not a skill; a real CLI command. #added:2026-02-06-184257
- [ ] Add topic-based navigation to blog when post count reaches 15+ #priority:low #added:2026-02-07-015054
- [ ] Review hook diagnostic logs after a long session. Check `.context/logs/check-persistence.log` and `.context/logs/check-context-size.log` to verify hooks fire correctly. Tune nudge frequency if needed. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-09
- [ ] Run `/consolidate` to address codebase drift. Considerable drift has
      accumulated (predicate naming, magic strings, hardcoded permissions,
      godoc style). #priority:medium #added:2026-02-06
- [ ] `/ctx-journal-enrich-all` should handle export-if-needed: check for
      unexported sessions before enriching and export them automatically,
      so the user can say "process the journal" and the skill handles the
      full pipeline (export → normalize → enrich). #priority:medium #added:2026-02-09
- [ ] Add `--date` or `--since`/`--until` flags to `ctx recall list` for
      date range filtering. Currently the agent eyeballs dates from the
      full list output, which works but is inefficient for large session
      histories. #priority:low #added:2026-02-09
- [ ] Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md: add architecture overview for contributors
      (package map), how to add a new command (pattern to follow), how to
      add a new parser (interface to implement), how to create a skill
      (directory structure), and test expectations per package. Lowers the
      contribution barrier. #priority:medium #source:report-6 #added:2026-02-17
- [ ] Aider/Cursor parser implementations: the recall architecture was
      designed for extensibility (tool-agnostic Session type with
      tool-specific parsers). Adding basic Aider and Cursor parsers would
      validate the parser interface, broaden the user base, and fulfill
      the "works with any AI tool" promise. Aider format is simpler than
      Claude Code's. #priority:medium #source:report-6 #added:2026-02-17

**GitHub Issues**:

- [x] GH-6: Fix `ctx journal site --build` silent failure on macOS system
      Python 3.9. The stub package v0.0.2 installs but has no CLI binary.
      Update error message to suggest `pipx install zensical` and note
      Python >= 3.10 requirement. #priority:high #source:github-issue-6
      #added:2026-02-11 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Updated error messages in journal/err.go and serve/err.go
      to include "(requires Python >= 3.10)".

- [x] GH-8: Replace `pip install zensical` → `pipx install zensical` across
      docs and Go error messages. 5 doc files + 4 Go source locations need
      updating. Keep Makefile's `.venv/bin/pip install` as-is (venv context).
      See issue for full file:line inventory. #priority:high #source:github-issue-8
      #added:2026-02-11 #done:2026-02-17
      Done: Go source already used pipx. Replaced Makefile .venv approach
      with direct pipx/zensical calls. Updated docs/contributing.md.
