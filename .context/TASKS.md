# Tasks — Context CLI

# Tasks

## Phase 0: Cleanup from the previous version

(All tasks archived)

### Phase 1: Parser (DONE)


## Phase 1.a: Cleanup and Release

- [x] T1.2.0.1b Add index markers to DECISIONS.md and LEARNINGS.md templates
      so new projects start with index structure #priority:low #added:2026-01-29
- [x] T1.2.5 feat: implement `--context-dir` global flag to override context directory path
  Documented in cli-reference.md as planned. Should allow `ctx --context-dir /path status`.
  #priority:low #added:2026-01-28
- [x] T1.2.6 feat: implement `--quiet` global flag to suppress non-essential output
  Documented in cli-reference.md as planned.
  #priority:low #added:2026-01-28
- [x] T1.2.7 feat: implement `--no-color` global flag to disable colored output
  Documented in cli-reference.md as planned. Currently `NO_COLOR=1` env var works.
  #priority:low #added:2026-01-28
- [ ] T1.2.9: upstream CI is broken (again)
- [ ] T1.2.10: Human code review
- [ ] T1.2.11: Human to read all user-facing documentation and update as needed.
- [ ] T1.2.12: cut a release (version number is already bumped)

### Phase 2: Export & Search

- [ ] feat: `ctx recall export` - export sessions to editable journal files
  - `ctx recall export <session-id>` - export one session
  - `ctx recall export --all` - export all sessions
  - Skip existing files (user may have edited), `--force` to overwrite
  - Output to `.context/journal/YYYY-MM-DD-slug-shortid.md`
  #added:2026-01-28

- [ ] feat: `ctx recall search <query>` - CLI-based search across sessions
  - Simple text search, no server needed
  - IDE grep is alternative, this is convenience
  #priority:low

- [ ] explore: `ctx recall stats` - analytics/statistics
  - Token usage over time, tool patterns, session durations
  - Explore when we have a clear use case
  #priority:deferred

## Backlog

- [ ] Write AST-based test that warns if CLI functions use fmt.Print* instead of cmd.Print* #added:2026-01-29-171351

- [ ] feat: ctx journal - LLM-powered session analysis and synthesis

Parent command for working with exported sessions (.context/journal/):

Subcommands to explore:
- ctx journal enrich: Add frontmatter/tags (topics, type, outcome, key files)
- ctx journal cluster: Group related sessions, build continuation chains
- ctx journal summarize: Generate timeline summaries, feature narratives
- ctx journal analyze: Find patterns (recurring mistakes, revisited decisions, coupling)
- ctx journal brief <topic>: Generate compressed context packet for a topic
- ctx journal site: Generate static site via zensical (browse, search, timeline)
Additional supporting context:

Depends on: ctx recall export (Phase 2)
#priority:low #phase:future #added:2026-01-28-071638

- [ ] feat: /ctx-blog slash command - generate blog post draft from recent activity

Analyzes what happened since last blog post:
- Sessions and their summaries
- Commits and features added
- Decisions made and rationale
- Learnings discovered

Outputs narrative markdown draft for human editing.
Could integrate with ctx journal or work directly from sessions/git history.

Related: ctx journal summarize (internal) vs ctx-blog (external/public)
#priority:low #phase:future #added:2026-01-28-072625

- [ ] feat: ctx enrich - retroactively expand sparse context entries

Finds one-liner learnings/decisions and expands them:
1. Locate sparse entries (missing Context/Lesson/Application)
2. Find originating session via timestamp correlation
3. Read surrounding context from that session
4. Generate full structured entry for human review

Could run as:
- ctx enrich --learnings (expand sparse learnings)
- ctx enrich --decisions (expand sparse decisions)
- ctx enrich --all (both)
- ctx enrich --dry-run (show what would be expanded)
