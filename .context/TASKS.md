# Tasks — Context CLI

# Tasks

## Phase 0: Cleanup from the previous version

- [ ] T0.1.0: Bugs
  - [x] `ctx init` currently appends to the end of and existing CLAUDE.md file;
    it would be better to find the first heading, and if it's a level one heading,
    (likely the title of the document), insert the new section "after it" (since
    the template has level-2 and lower headings), if not add it to the top of
    the file—things get missing to see/recognize (for the human) and
    (more importantly) deprioritized (for the machine) when
    it is written all the way to the end of the file.
  - [x] feat: the instructions say "always offer to save context", however,
    that's too late for the LLM because the session will be terminated before
    it can take action. you (the LLM) have no control over offering stuff
    during context end; so, you need to be proactive: Maybe at every critical
    decision, and after every few interactions you have to offer to save context.
    This needs to be arranged the best way possible (maybe a hint/instruction
    to the LLM in the template files, or maybe something else)
    #started:2026-01-26-034500 #done:2026-01-26-035700
  - [x] The LLM should also be proactive in saving decision when it makes
    sense; and suggesting new tasks. #started:2026-01-26-034500 #done:2026-01-26-035700
  - [x] Bug in hook creation:
    ```text
    /home/volkan/WORKSPACE/spike/.claude/settings.local.json
    └ hooks
    ├ PreToolUseHooks: Invalid key in record
    └ SessionEndHooks: Invalid key in record
    ```
    1. the "Hooks" suffix is not in the schema;
    2. the generated settings.local.json had unicode characters that broke the interpretation.
    make sure the file is properly-generated, and it works as expected.
    #started:2026-01-26-051500 #done:2026-01-26-052200
  - [x]: `/ctx-save` slash command triggers approval prompt despite using ```` ```! ````
    auto-execute syntax. The command should run without requiring manual approval.
    #done:2026-01-27 (ctx session:* permission added to settings.local.json)
  - [x]: `/ctx-release` should also update the versions in docs/index.md
    #done:2026-01-27 (hack/release.sh lines 94-102 handle this automatically)
  - [x] Implement .contextrc config file support (YAML format)
    #priority:low #added:2026-01-27-065231 #done:2026-01-27
  - [x] Change ctx add to prepend (not append) entries in DECISIONS.md and
    LEARNINGS.md for reverse-chronological order #priority:medium
    #added:2026-01-27-065902 #done:2026-01-27
  - [x] Add required --context, --rationale, --consequences flags to ctx add
    decision command; command should fail if flags are missing to enforce
    complete decision records #priority:medium #added:2026-01-27-070542
    #done:2026-01-27  
  - [x]: docs should have a page that has links to snapshotted doc version
    (a list of links on the public docs in a separate page; links to
    tagged docs on GitHub for simplicity).
    `/ctx-release` should update that page too.
    #done:2026-01-27 (created docs/versions.md, updated hack/release.sh)

- [ ] T0.1.1: Social
  - [ ] Remind to Human: have a proper email for security vulnerability reports.
  - [ ] Trace the entire git history and sessions, create an extensive document
    of what we did and how it progressed, and then create a blog post about it.
    this may require a larger thinking budget; don't shy away from spending
    tokens, we have plenty.

### Phase 1: Parser

[ ] T1.1.0: Create a CLI command and a slash command (for Claude) to parse 
    "summary" session capture markdowns, and enrich them by parsing the
    corresponding JSONL file(s).

- [ ] T1.1.1: Define data structures in `internal/recall/parser/types.go`
  - `SessionMessage`, `Session`, `ContentBlock` interface
  - `TextBlock`, `ThinkingBlock`, `ToolUseBlock`, `ToolResultBlock`
  - `TokenUsage` struct
  - Must match `specs/recall/v0.1.0/01-session-schema.md`

- [ ] T1.1.2: Implement line parser in `internal/recall/parser/parser.go`
  - `ParseLine(line []byte) (*SessionMessage, error)`
  - Handle malformed JSON (return error, don't panic)
  - Handle missing optional fields with defaults

- [ ] T1.1.3: Implement session grouper
  - `ParseFile(path string) (map[string]*Session, error)`
  - Stream lines, don't load entire file into memory
  - Sort messages by timestamp within each session
  - Calculate: TurnCount, TotalTokensIn, TotalTokensOut, Duration

- [ ] T1.1.4: Implement directory scanner
  - `ScanDirectory(path string) ([]*Session, error)`
  - Recurse into subdirectories
  - Skip non-JSONL files
  - Aggregate sessions across files

### Phase 2: Renderer

- [ ] T1.2.1: Set up template system in `internal/recall/renderer/`
  - Use `//go:embed` for templates
  - Create `templates/layout.html` with dark mode CSS
  - Create `templates/index.html`
  - Create `templates/session.html`

- [ ] T1.2.2: Implement markdown renderer
  - Add goldmark + chroma dependencies
  - `RenderMarkdown(text string) template.HTML`
  - Enable GFM extensions
  - Syntax highlighting with monokai theme

- [ ] T1.2.3: Implement session renderer
  - `RenderSession(session *Session) (*RenderedSession, error)`
  - Wrap thinking blocks in `<details>` (collapsed by default)
  - Format tool calls with syntax-highlighted input/output

- [ ] T1.2.4: Implement index renderer
  - `RenderIndex(sessions []*Session, filters Filters) (*RenderedIndex, error)`
  - Sort by date (newest first)
  - Include preview (first 100 chars of first user message)
  - Show aggregate stats

### Phase 3: Server

- [ ] T1.3.1: Set up HTTP server in `internal/recall/server/`
  - Standard library `net/http`
  - Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
  - Embed static assets with `//go:embed`

- [ ] T1.3.2: Implement index route
  - `GET /` — render index page
  - `GET /?project=X` — filter by project
  - `GET /?after=DATE&before=DATE` — filter by date
  - `GET /?q=QUERY` — search sessions

- [ ] T1.3.3: Implement session detail route
  - `GET /session/:id` — render session detail
  - 404 if not found
  - Include back link to index

- [ ] T1.3.4: Implement API routes
  - `GET /api/sessions` — JSON session list
  - `GET /api/session/:id` — JSON session detail

### Phase 4: Search

- [ ] T1.4.1: Implement search index in `internal/recall/search/`
  - Inverted index: term → sessionIds
  - `Build(sessions []*Session)`
  - Tokenize: lowercase, split whitespace, remove punctuation

- [ ] T1.4.2: Implement search query
  - `Search(query string, limit int) []string`
  - AND semantics (all terms must match)
  - Sort by term frequency score

### Phase 5: CLI

- [ ] T1.5.1: Add recall subcommand
  - Create `cmd/ctx/recall.go`
  - `ctx recall serve <path>` — start server
  - `--port` flag (default: 8080)
  - `--open` flag to open browser

- [ ] T1.5.2: Add help and validation
  - Validate path exists and has JSONL files
  - Print URL when server starts
  - Print stats (sessions loaded, time taken)

## Backlog

- [x] Rename vars in the config package.
- [x] Why is agent runbook lowest in reading priority order?
  - follow-up: is it enforced?
- [x] Create a list of what CLI options (if any) are not implemented yet.
- [x] Verify all Markdown files by "actually reading them"; take notes for
  follow-up actions.
- [x] All go code should have godoc and testing.
- [x] GitHub CI linter is giving errors that need fixing.
- [x] Manual code review. take notes.
- [x] Add tests per file.
- [x] validate everything in the docs with a skeptical eye.
- [x] consider the case where `ctx` is not called from within AI prompt:
  - does the command still make sense?
  - does it create the expected output?
- [x] Cut the first release.
  - Versioning strategy.
  - Always have a `latest` tag pointing to the latest release.
  - Or, maybe just use the `latest` tag at all times?
- [x] compare versions of recent change and the last AI-assisted version and
      ask AI what we have learned about this.
