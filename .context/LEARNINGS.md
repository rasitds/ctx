## [2026-02-04-230943] JSONL session files are append-only

**Context**: Built context-watch.sh monitor; it showed 90% after compaction while /context showed 16%

**Lesson**: Claude Code JSONL files never shrink after compaction. Any monitoring tool based on file size will overreport post-compaction. The /context command shows actual tokens sent to the model.

**Application**: Per ctx workflow, sessions should end before compaction fires — so JSONL size is a valid time-to-wrap-up signal. Don't try to make context-watch.sh compaction-aware.

## [2026-02-04-230941] Most external skill files are redundant with Claude's system prompt

**Context**: Reviewed ~30 external skill/prompt files during systematic skill audit

**Lesson**: Only ~20% had salvageable content — and even those yielded just a few heuristics each. The signal is in the knowledge delta, not the word count.

**Application**: When evaluating new skills, apply E/A/R classification ruthlessly. Default to delete. Only keep content an expert would say took years to learn.

## [2026-02-04-193920] Skills that restate or contradict Claude Code's built-in system prompt create tension, not clarity. The system prompt already covers: avoid over-engineering, don't add unnecessary features, prefer simplicity. Skills should complement the system prompt, not compete with it. Before writing a skill, check if the guidance already exists in the platform.

**Context**: Reviewing entropy.txt skill that duplicated system prompt guidance about code minimalism

**Lesson**: Skills that conflict with system prompts cause unpredictable behavior — the AI has to reconcile contradictory instructions

**Application**: When evaluating or writing skills, first check Claude Code's system prompt defaults. Only create skills for guidance the platform does NOT already provide.

## [2026-02-04-192812] Skill files that suppress AI judgment are jailbreak patterns, not productivity tools. Red flags: <EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT> urgency tags, 'you cannot rationalize' overrides, tables that label hesitation as wrong, absurdly low thresholds (1%). The fix for 'AI forgets skills' is better skill descriptions, not overriding reasoning. Discard these entirely — nothing is salvageable.

**Context**: Reviewing power.txt skill that forced skill invocation on every message

**Lesson**: Jailbreak-structured prompts should be identified and discarded, not refined

**Application**: When evaluating skills, check for judgment-suppression patterns before assessing content
