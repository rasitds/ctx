## What It Is

A one-liner scratchpad, encrypted at rest, synced via git.

Quick notes that don't fit decisions, learnings, or tasks: reminders,
intermediate values, sensitive tokens, working memory during debugging.
Entries are numbered, reorderable, and persist across sessions.

## Encrypted by Default

Scratchpad entries are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before touching disk.

| Component | Path | Git status |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Encryption key | `.context/.scratchpad.key` | Gitignored, `0600` permissions |
| Encrypted data | `.context/scratchpad.enc` | Committed |

The key is generated automatically during `ctx init` (256-bit via
`crypto/rand`). The ciphertext format is `[12-byte nonce][ciphertext+tag]`.
No external dependencies — Go stdlib only.

Because the key is gitignored and the data is committed, you get:

* **At-rest encryption**: the `.enc` file is opaque without the key
* **Git sync**: push/pull the encrypted file like any other tracked file
* **Key separation**: the key never leaves the machine unless you copy it

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ctx pad` | List all entries (numbered 1-based) |
| `ctx pad show N` | Output raw text of entry N (no prefix, pipe-friendly) |
| `ctx pad add "text"` | Append a new entry |
| `ctx pad rm N` | Remove entry at position N |
| `ctx pad edit N "text"` | Replace entry N with new text |
| `ctx pad edit N --append "text"` | Append text to the end of entry N |
| `ctx pad edit N --prepend "text"` | Prepend text to the beginning of entry N |
| `ctx pad mv N M` | Move entry from position N to position M |
| `ctx pad resolve` | Show both sides of a merge conflict for resolution |

All commands decrypt on read, operate on plaintext in memory, and
re-encrypt on write. The key file is never printed to stdout.

### Examples

```bash
# Add a note
ctx pad add "check DNS propagation after deploy"

# List everything
ctx pad
#   1. check DNS propagation after deploy
#   2. staging API key: sk-test-abc123

# Show raw text (for piping)
ctx pad show 2
# sk-test-abc123

# Compose entries
ctx pad edit 1 --append "$(ctx pad show 2)"

# Reorder
ctx pad mv 2 1

# Clean up
ctx pad rm 2
```

## Using with AI

The `/ctx-pad` skill maps natural language to `ctx pad` commands. You
don't need to remember the syntax:

| You say | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "jot down: check DNS after deploy" | `ctx pad add "check DNS after deploy"` |
| "show my scratchpad" | `ctx pad` |
| "delete the third entry" | `ctx pad rm 3` |
| "update entry 2 to include the new endpoint" | `ctx pad edit 2 "..."` |
| "move entry 4 to the top" | `ctx pad mv 4 1` |

The skill handles the translation. You describe what you want in plain
English; the agent picks the right command.

## Key Distribution

The encryption key (`.context/.scratchpad.key`) stays on the machine
where it was generated. ctx never transmits it.

To share the scratchpad across machines:

1. Copy the key manually: `scp`, USB drive, password manager
2. Push/pull the `.enc` file via git as usual
3. Both machines can now read and write the same scratchpad

!!! warning "Never Commit the Key"
    The key is gitignored by default. If you override this, anyone with
    repo access can decrypt your scratchpad. Treat the key like an SSH
    private key.

See the [Syncing Scratchpad Notes Across Machines](recipes/scratchpad-sync.md)
recipe for a step-by-step walkthrough.

## Plaintext Override

For projects where encryption is unnecessary, disable it in `.contextrc`:

```yaml
scratchpad_encrypt: false
```

In plaintext mode:

* Entries are stored in `.context/scratchpad.md` instead of `.enc`
* No key is generated or required
* All `ctx pad` commands work identically
* The file is human-readable and diffable

!!! tip "When to Use Plaintext"
    Plaintext mode is useful for non-sensitive projects, solo work where
    encryption adds friction, or when you want scratchpad entries visible
    in `git diff`.

## When to Use Scratchpad vs Context Files

| Use case | Where it goes |
|----------|--------------|
| Temporary reminders ("check X after deploy") | Scratchpad |
| Working values during debugging | Scratchpad |
| Sensitive tokens or API keys (short-term) | Scratchpad |
| Quick notes that don't fit anywhere else | Scratchpad |
| Work items with completion tracking | `TASKS.md` |
| Trade-offs with rationale | `DECISIONS.md` |
| Reusable lessons with context/lesson/application | `LEARNINGS.md` |
| Codified patterns and standards | `CONVENTIONS.md` |

**Rule of thumb**: if it needs structure or will be referenced months later,
use a context file. If it's working memory for the current session or week,
use the scratchpad.
