# Context as Infrastructure

![ctx](../images/ctx-banner.png)

## Why Your AI Needs a Filesystem, Not a Prompt

*Jose Alekhinne / February 17, 2026*

!!! question "Where does your AI's knowledge live between sessions?"
    If the answer is "in a prompt I paste at the start," you are treating
    context as a **consumable**. Something assembled, used, and discarded.

    What if you treated it as **infrastructure** instead?

This post synthesizes a thread that has been running through every
`ctx` blog post -- from the [origin story][origin-post] to the
[attention budget][attention-post] to the [discipline release][v030].
The thread is this: **context is not a prompt problem. It is an
infrastructure problem.** And the tools we build for it should look
more like filesystems than clipboard managers.

## The Prompt Paradigm

Most AI-assisted development treats context as ephemeral:

1. Start a session.
2. Paste your system prompt, your conventions, your current task.
3. Work.
4. Session ends. Everything evaporates.
5. Next session: paste again.

This works for short interactions. For sustained development (*where
decisions compound over days and weeks*) it fails in three ways:

**It does not persist**: A *decision* made on Tuesday must be re-explained
on Wednesday. A *learning* captured in one session is invisible to the
next.

**It does not scale**: As the project grows, the "*paste everything*"
approach hits the context window ceiling. You start triaging what to
include, often cutting exactly the context that would have prevented
the next mistake.

**It does not compose**: A system prompt is a monolith. You cannot
load part of it, update one section, or share a subset with a different
workflow. It is all or nothing.

!!! warning "The Copy-Paste Tax"
    Every session that starts with pasting a prompt is paying a tax:

    The human time to assemble the context, the risk of forgetting
    something, and the silent assumption that yesterday's prompt is
    still accurate today.

    Over 70+ sessions, that tax compounds into a significant
    maintenance burden: One that most developers absorb without
    questioning it.

---

## The Infrastructure Paradigm

`ctx` takes a different approach:

Context is not assembled per-session;
it is **maintained as persistent files** in a `.context/` directory:

```
.context/
  CONSTITUTION.md     # Inviolable rules
  TASKS.md            # Current work items
  CONVENTIONS.md      # Code patterns and standards
  DECISIONS.md        # Architectural choices with rationale
  LEARNINGS.md        # Gotchas and lessons learned
  ARCHITECTURE.md     # System structure
  GLOSSARY.md         # Domain terminology
  AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md   # Operating manual for agents
  journal/            # Enriched session summaries
  archive/            # Completed work, cold storage
```

* Each file has a single purpose;
* Each can be loaded independently;
* Each persists across **sessions**, **tools**, and **team members**.

This is not a novel idea. It is the same idea behind every piece of
infrastructure software engineers already use:

| Traditional Infrastructure | ctx Equivalent              |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Database                   | `.context/*.md` files       |
| Configuration files        | `CONSTITUTION.md`           |
| Environment variables      | `.contextrc`                |
| Log files                  | `journal/`                  |
| Schema migrations          | Decision records            |
| Deployment manifests       | `AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`         |

The parallel is not metaphorical. Context files **are** infrastructure:

* They are versioned (*`git` tracks them*); 
* They are structured (*Markdown with conventions*); 
* They have schemas (*required fields for decisions and learnings*); 
* And they have lifecycle management (*archiving, compaction, indexing*).

---

## Separation of Concerns

The most important design decision in `ctx` is not any individual
feature. It is the **separation of context into distinct files with
distinct purposes**.

A single `CONTEXT.md` file would be simpler to implement. It would
also be impossible to maintain.

Why? Because different types of context have different lifecycles:

| Context Type | Changes       | Read By          | Load When          |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Constitution | Rarely        | Every session    | Always             |
| Tasks        | Every session | Session start    | Always             |
| Conventions  | Weekly        | Before coding    | When writing code  |
| Decisions    | When decided  | When questioning | When revisiting    |
| Learnings    | When learned  | When stuck       | When debugging     |
| Journal      | Every session | Rarely           | When investigating |

Loading everything into every session wastes the
[attention budget][attention-post] on context that is irrelevant to
the current task. Loading nothing forces the AI to operate blind.

Separation of concerns allows **progressive disclosure**: 

Load the **minimum** that matters for **this moment**, with the 
**option** to load more when **needed**.

```bash
# Session start: load the essentials
ctx agent --budget 4000

# Deep investigation: load everything
cat .context/DECISIONS.md
cat .context/journal/2026-02-05-*.md
```

The filesystem is the index. File names, directory structure, and
timestamps encode relevance. The AI does not need to read every file;
it needs to know **where to look**.

---

## The Two-Tier Persistence Model

`ctx` uses two tiers of persistence, and the distinction is
architectural:

| Tier          | Purpose                 | Location                 | Token Cost             |
|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Curated**   | Quick context reload    | `.context/*.md`          | Low (budgeted)         |
| **Full dump** | Safety net, archaeology | `.context/journal/*.md`  | Zero (not auto-loaded) |

The curated tier is what the AI sees at session start. It is
optimized for signal density: 

* Structured entries, 
* Indexed tables,
* Reverse-chronological order (*newest first, so the most relevant
  content survives truncation*).

The full dump tier is for humans and for deep investigation. It
contains everything: enriched journals, archived tasks. It is never
auto-loaded because its volume would destroy attention density.

This two-tier model is analogous to how traditional systems separate
hot and cold storage. The hot path (curated context) is optimized for
read performance -- measured not in milliseconds, but in
**tokens consumed per unit of useful information**. The cold path
(journal) is optimized for completeness.

!!! tip "Nothing Is Ever Truly Lost"
    The full dump tier means that context does not need to be
    *perfect* -- it just needs to be *findable*.

    A decision that was not captured in DECISIONS.md can be recovered
    from the session transcript where it was discussed. A learning
    that was not formalized can be found in the journal entry from
    that day.

    The curated tier is the fast path. The full dump tier is the
    safety net.

## Decision Records as First-Class Citizens

One of the patterns that emerged from `ctx`'s own development is
the power of **structured decision records**.

v0.1.0 allowed adding decisions as one-liners:

```bash
ctx add decision "Use PostgreSQL"
```

v0.2.0 enforced structure:

```bash
ctx add decision "Use PostgreSQL" \
  --context "Need a reliable database for user data" \
  --rationale "ACID compliance, team familiarity" \
  --consequences "Need connection pooling, team training"
```

The difference is not cosmetic. A one-liner decision teaches the AI
*what* was decided. A structured decision teaches it *why* -- and
*why* is what prevents the AI from unknowingly reversing the decision
in a future session.

This is infrastructure thinking: decisions are not notes. They are
**records** with required fields, just like database rows have schemas.
The enforcement exists because incomplete records are worse than no
records -- they create false confidence that the context is captured
when it is not.

---

## The "IDE Is the Interface" Decision

Early in `ctx`'s development, there was a temptation to build a custom
UI: a web dashboard for browsing sessions, editing context, viewing
analytics.

The decision was **no**. The IDE is the interface.

```
# This is the ctx "UI":
code .context/
```

This decision was not about minimalism for its own sake. It was about
recognizing that `.context/` files are **just files** -- and files have
a mature, well-understood infrastructure:

- **Version control**: `git diff .context/DECISIONS.md` shows exactly
  what changed and when.
- **Search**: Your IDE's full-text search works across all context files.
- **Editing**: Markdown in any editor, with preview, spell check,
  and syntax highlighting.
- **Collaboration**: Pull requests on context files work the same as
  pull requests on code.

Building a custom UI would have meant maintaining a parallel
infrastructure that duplicates what every IDE already provides. It
would have introduced its own bugs, its own update cycle, and its
own learning curve.

The filesystem is not a limitation. It is **the most mature, most
composable, most portable infrastructure available**.

!!! info "Context Files in Git"
    Because `.context/` lives in the repository, context changes are
    part of the commit history. A decision made in commit `abc123` is
    as traceable as a code change in the same commit.

    This is not possible with prompt-based context, which exists
    outside version control entirely.

## Progressive Disclosure for AI

The concept of progressive disclosure comes from human interface
design: show the user the minimum needed to make progress, with the
option to drill deeper.

`ctx` applies the same principle to AI context:

| Level   | What the AI Sees              | Token Cost | When             |
|---------|-------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| Level 0 | `ctx status` (one-line summary)| ~100      | Quick check      |
| Level 1 | `ctx agent --budget 4000`     | ~4,000     | Normal work      |
| Level 2 | `ctx agent --budget 8000`     | ~8,000     | Complex tasks    |
| Level 3 | Direct file reads             | 10,000+    | Deep investigation|

Each level trades tokens for depth. Level 1 is sufficient for most
work: the AI knows the active tasks, the key conventions, and the
recent decisions. Level 3 is for archaeology: understanding why a
decision was made three weeks ago, or finding a pattern in the session
history.

The explicit `--budget` flag is the mechanism that makes this work.
Without it, the default behavior would be to load everything (because
more context *feels* safer), which destroys the attention density that
makes the loaded context useful.

**The constraint is the feature.** A budget of 4,000 tokens forces
`ctx` to prioritize ruthlessly: constitution first (always full), then
tasks and conventions (budget-capped), then decisions and learnings
scored by recency and relevance to active tasks. Entries that don't
fit get title-only summaries rather than being silently dropped.

## The Philosophical Shift

The shift from "context as prompt" to "context as infrastructure"
changes how you think about AI-assisted development:

| Prompt Thinking                  | Infrastructure Thinking              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| "What do I paste today?"         | "What has changed since yesterday?"  |
| "How do I fit everything in?"    | "What's the minimum that matters?"   |
| "The AI forgot my conventions"   | "The conventions are in a file"      |
| "I need to re-explain"           | "I need to update the record"        |
| "This session is getting slow"   | "Time to compact and archive"        |

The first column treats AI interaction as a conversation. The second
treats it as a **system** -- one that can be maintained, optimized,
and debugged.

Context is not something you *give* the AI. It is something you
**maintain** -- like a database, like a config file, like any other
piece of infrastructure that a running system depends on.

---

## Beyond ctx: The Principles

The patterns that `ctx` implements are not specific to `ctx`. They are
applicable to any project that uses AI-assisted development:

1. **Separate context by purpose.** Do not put everything in one file.
   Different types of information have different lifecycles and
   different relevance windows.

2. **Make context persistent.** If a decision matters, write it down
   in a file that survives the session. If a learning matters, capture
   it with structure.

3. **Budget explicitly.** Know how much context you are loading and
   whether it is worth the attention cost.

4. **Use the filesystem.** File names, directory structure, and
   timestamps are metadata that the AI can navigate. A well-organized
   directory is an index that costs zero tokens to maintain.

5. **Version your context.** Put context files in git. Changes to
   decisions are as important as changes to code.

6. **Design for degradation.** Sessions will get long. Attention will
   dilute. Build mechanisms (compaction, archiving, cooldowns) that
   make degradation visible and manageable.

These are not `ctx` features. They are **infrastructure principles**
that happen to be implemented as a CLI tool. Any team could implement
them with nothing more than a directory convention and a few shell
scripts.

The tool is a convenience. The principles are what matter.

!!! quote "If you remember one thing from this post..."
    **Prompts are conversations. Infrastructure persists.**

    Your AI does not need a better prompt. It needs a filesystem:
    versioned, structured, budgeted, and maintained.

    **The best context is the context that was there before
    you started the session.**

## The Arc

This post is the architectural companion to the
[Attention Budget][attention-post]. That post explained *why* context
must be curated (token economics). This one explains *how* to
structure it (filesystem, separation of concerns, persistence tiers).

Together with [Code Is Cheap, Judgment Is Not][judgment-post], they
form a trilogy about what matters in AI-assisted development:

- **Attention Budget**: the resource you're managing
- **Context as Infrastructure**: the system you build to manage it
- **Code Is Cheap**: the human skill that no system replaces

And the practices that keep it all honest:

- [The 3:1 Ratio][ratio-post]: the cadence for maintaining both
  code and context
- [IRC as Context][irc-post]: the historical precedent -- stateless
  protocols have always needed stateful wrappers
