### [Defense in Depth: Securing AI Agents](2026-02-09-defense-in-depth-securing-ai-agents.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 9, 2026*

I was writing the autonomous loops recipe and realized the security
advice was "use CONSTITUTION.md for guardrails." Then I read that
sentence back and realized: that is wishful thinking. This post
traces five defense layers for unattended AI agents, each with a
bypass, and shows why the strength is in the combination, not any
single layer.

**Topics**: agent security, defense in depth, prompt injection,
autonomous loops, container isolation

### [Not Everything Is a Skill](2026-02-08-not-everything-is-a-skill.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 8, 2026*

I ran an 8-agent codebase audit and got actionable results. The natural
instinct was to wrap the prompt as a `/ctx-audit` skill. Then I applied
my own criteria from the skill trilogy: **it failed all three tests**.
This post is about the difference between skills and recipes, why the
attention budget applies to your skill library too, and why the best
automation decision is sometimes not to automate.

**Topics**: skill design, context engineering, automation discipline,
recipes, agent teams

### [The Anatomy of a Skill That Works](2026-02-07-the-anatomy-of-a-skill-that-works.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 7, 2026*

I had 20 skills. Most were well-intentioned stubs: a description, a command,
and a wish for the best. Then I rewrote all of them in a single session.
**Seven lessons emerged**: quality gates prevent premature execution, negative
triggers are load-bearing, examples set boundaries better than rules, and
skills are contracts, not instructions. The practical companion to the
previous two skill design posts.

**Topics**: skill design, context engineering, quality gates, E/A/R framework,
practical patterns

### [You Can't Import Expertise](2026-02-05-you-cant-import-expertise.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 5, 2026*

I found a well-crafted consolidation skill: four files, ten patterns, eight
analysis dimensions. Applied my own E/A/R framework: **70% was noise**. The
template was thorough, correct, and almost entirely useless for my project.
This post is about why good skills can't be copy-pasted, and how to grow
them from your project's own drift history instead.

**Topics**: skill adaptation, E/A/R framework, convention drift, consolidation,
project-specific expertise

### [Skills That Fight the Platform](2026-02-04-skills-that-fight-the-platform.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 4, 2026*

AI coding agents ship with carefully designed system prompts. When custom
skills conflict with those defaults, the AI has to **reconcile contradictory
instructions**: The result is **unpredictable**. This post catalogues five
conflict patterns discovered while building `ctx`: judgment suppression,
redundant guidance, guilt-tripping, phantom dependencies, and universal
triggers.

**Topics**: context engineering, skill design, system prompts, antipatterns,
AI safety primitives

### [The Attention Budget: Why Your AI Forgets What You Just Told It](2026-02-03-the-attention-budget.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 3, 2026*

Every token you send to an AI consumes a finite resource: **the attention budget**.
Understanding this constraint shaped every design decision in ctx: hierarchical
file structure, explicit budgets, progressive disclosure, and filesystem-as-index.
This post explains the theory and how ctx operationalizes it.

**Topics**: attention mechanics, context engineering, progressive disclosure,
ctx primitives, token budgets

### [ctx v0.2.0: The Archaeology Release](2026-02-01-ctx-v0.2.0-the-archaeology-release.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 1, 2026*

What if your AI could remember everything? Not just the current session, but
every session. `ctx v0.2.0` introduces the **recall** and **journal** systems:
making 86 commits of history searchable, exportable, and analyzable. 
This post tells the story of why those features exist.

**Topics**: session recall, journal system, structured entries, token budgets,
meta-tools

### [Refactoring with Intent: Human-Guided Sessions in AI Development](2026-02-01-refactoring-with-intent.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 1, 2026*

The **YOLO mode shipped** **14 commands** **in a week**. But technical debt 
doesn't send invoices:it just waits. This is the story of what happened when 
we stopped auto-accepting everything and started guiding the AI with intent: 
27 commits across 4 days, a major version release, and lessons that apply far 
beyond ctx.

**Topics**: refactoring, code quality, documentation standards, module
decomposition, YOLO versus intentional development

### [Building ctx Using ctx: A Meta-Experiment in AI-Assisted Development](2026-01-27-building-ctx-using-ctx.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / January 27, 2026*

What happens when you build a tool designed to give AI memory, using that very
same tool to remember what you're building? **This is the story of `ctx`**:
how `ctx` evolved from a hasty "*YOLO*" experiment to a **disciplined system** 
for persistent AI context, and what we learned along the way.

**Topics**: dogfooding, AI-assisted development, Ralph Loop, session
persistence, architectural decisions
