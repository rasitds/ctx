# Eight Ways a Hook Can Talk

## When Your Warning Disappears

*Jose Alekhinne / 2026-02-15*

I had a backup warning that nobody ever saw.

The hook was correct — it detected stale backups, formatted a nice message,
and output it as `{"systemMessage": "..."}`. The problem wasn't detection.
The problem was delivery. The agent absorbed the information, processed it
internally, and never told the user.

Meanwhile, a different hook — the journal reminder — worked perfectly every
time. Users saw the reminder, ran the commands, and the backlog stayed
manageable. Same hook event (`UserPromptSubmit`), same project, completely
different outcomes.

The difference was one line:

```
IMPORTANT: Relay this journal reminder to the user VERBATIM
before answering their question.
```

That explicit instruction is what makes VERBATIM relay a *pattern*, not
just a formatting choice. And once I saw it as a pattern, I started seeing
others.

## The Audit

I looked at every hook in the ctx project — eight shell scripts across
three hook events — and found five distinct output patterns already in use,
plus three more that the existing hooks were reaching for but hadn't quite
articulated.

The patterns form a spectrum based on a single question: **who decides what
the user sees?**

At one end, the hook decides everything (hard gate: the agent literally
cannot proceed). At the other end, the hook is invisible (silent
side-effect: nobody knows it ran). In between, there is a range of
negotiation between hook, agent, and user.

Here's the full spectrum:

### 1. Hard Gate

```json
{"decision": "block", "reason": "Use ctx from PATH, not ./ctx"}
```

The nuclear option. The agent's tool call is rejected before it executes.
This is Claude Code's first-class `PreToolUse` mechanism — the hook returns
JSON with `decision: block` and the agent gets an error with the reason.

Use this for invariants. Constitution rules, security boundaries, things
that must never happen. We use it to enforce PATH-based ctx invocation,
block `sudo`, and require explicit approval for `git push`.

### 2. VERBATIM Relay

```
IMPORTANT: Relay this warning to the user VERBATIM before answering.
┌─ Journal Reminder ─────────────────────────────
│ You have 12 sessions not yet exported.
│   ctx recall export --all
└────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

The instruction is the pattern. Without "Relay VERBATIM," agents tend to
absorb information into their internal reasoning and never surface it. The
explicit instruction changes the behavior from "I know about this" to "I
must tell the user about this."

We use this for actionable reminders: unexported journal entries, stale
backups, context capacity warnings. Things the user should see regardless
of what they asked.

### 3. Agent Directive

```
┌─ Persistence Checkpoint (prompt #25) ───────────
│ No context files updated in 15+ prompts.
│ Have you discovered learnings worth persisting?
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

A nudge, not a command. The hook tells the agent something; the agent
decides what (if anything) to tell the user. This is right for behavioral
nudges — "you haven't saved context in a while" doesn't need to be relayed
verbatim, but the agent should consider acting on it.

### 4. Silent Context Injection

```bash
ctx agent --budget 4000 2>/dev/null || true
```

Pure background enrichment. The agent's context window gets project
information injected on every tool call, with no visible output. Neither
the agent nor the user sees the hook fire — but the agent makes better
decisions because of the context.

### 5. Silent Side-Effect

```bash
find "$CTX_TMPDIR" -type f -mtime +15 -delete
```

Do work, say nothing. Temp file cleanup on session end. Logging. Marker
file management. The action is the entire point; no one needs to know.

## The Patterns We Don't Have Yet

Three more patterns emerged from the gaps in the existing hooks.

**Conditional relay** — "Relay this, but only if the user's question is
about X." Avoids noise when the warning isn't relevant. More fragile
(depends on agent judgment) but less annoying.

**Suggested action** — "Here's a problem and here's the exact command to
fix it. Ask the user before running it." Goes beyond a nudge by giving the
agent a concrete proposal, but still requires human approval.

**Escalating severity** — `INFO` gets absorbed silently. `WARN` gets
mentioned at the next natural pause. `CRITICAL` gets the VERBATIM
treatment. A protocol for hooks that produce output at different urgency
levels, so they don't all compete for the user's attention.

## The Principle

The reason this matters: **hooks are the boundary between your environment
and the agent's reasoning**. A hook that detects a problem but can't
communicate it effectively is the same as no hook at all.

The format of your output is a design decision with real consequences:

- Use a hard gate and the agent *can't* proceed (good for invariants,
  frustrating for false positives)
- Use VERBATIM relay and the user *will* see it (good for reminders,
  noisy if overused)
- Use an agent directive and the agent *might* act (good for nudges,
  unreliable for critical warnings)
- Use silent injection and nobody *knows* (good for enrichment,
  invisible when it breaks)

Choose deliberately. And when in doubt, write the word VERBATIM.
