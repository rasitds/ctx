## `ctx`

`ctx` (*Context*) is a file-based system that enables AI coding assistants to
persist project knowledge across sessions. Instead of re-explaining your
codebase every time, context files let AI tools remember decisions,
conventions, and learnings:

* A session is interactive.
* `ctx` enables **cognitive continuity**.
* **Cognitive continuity** enables durable, *symbiotic-like* human–AI workflows.

!!! quote "The `ctx` Manifesto"
    **Creation, not code. Context, not prompts. Verification, not vibes.**

    Without durable context, intelligence resets.
    With `ctx`, creation compounds.

    `ctx` is free and open source software, and **contributions are always
    welcome** and appreciated.

## Why?

Most AI-driven development fails not because models are weak—they fail because 
**context is ephemeral**. Every new session starts near zero:

* You re-explain architecture
* The AI repeats past mistakes
* Decisions get rediscovered instead of remembered

`ctx` solves this by treating context as **infrastructure**: 
files that version with your code and persist across sessions.

## Installation

### Build from Source (*Recommended*)

Requires [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx.git
cd ctx
make build
sudo make install
# or:
# sudo mv ctx /usr/local/bin/
```

Building from source gives you the latest features and bug fixes. 

Since `ctx` is predominantly a developer tool, this is the 
**recommended approach**: 

You get the freshest code and can inspect what you are installing.

### Binary Downloads

Pre-built binaries are available from the
[releases page](https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases) if you prefer
not to build from source.

=== "Linux (x86_64)"

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases/download/v0.3.0/ctx-0.3.0-linux-amd64
    chmod +x ctx-0.3.0-linux-amd64
    sudo mv ctx-0.3.0-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/ctx
    ```

=== "Linux (ARM64)"

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases/download/v0.3.0/ctx-0.3.0-linux-arm64
    chmod +x ctx-0.3.0-linux-arm64
    sudo mv ctx-0.3.0-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/ctx
    ```

=== "macOS (Apple Silicon)"

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases/download/v0.3.0/ctx-0.3.0-darwin-arm64
    chmod +x ctx-0.3.0-darwin-arm64
    sudo mv ctx-0.3.0-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/ctx
    ```

=== "macOS (Intel)"

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases/download/v0.3.0/ctx-0.3.0-darwin-amd64
    chmod +x ctx-0.3.0-darwin-amd64
    sudo mv ctx-0.3.0-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/ctx
    ```

=== "Windows"

    Download `ctx-0.3.0-windows-amd64.exe` from the releases page and add it to your `PATH`.

#### Verifying Checksums

Each binary has a corresponding `.sha256` checksum file. To verify your download:

```bash
# Download the checksum file
curl -LO https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases/download/v0.3.0/ctx-0.3.0-linux-amd64.sha256

# Verify the binary
sha256sum -c ctx-0.3.0-linux-amd64.sha256
```

On macOS, use `shasum -a 256 -c` instead of `sha256sum -c`.

Verify installation:

```bash
ctx --version
```

### Version Control (Strongly Recommended)

`ctx` does not require git, but using version control with your `.context/`
directory is strongly recommended. AI sessions occasionally modify or
overwrite context files inadvertently. With git, the AI can check history
and restore lost content — without it, the data is gone. Several `ctx`
features (journal changelog, blog generation) also use git history directly.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Context

```bash
cd your-project
ctx init
```

This creates a `.context/` directory with template files and configures 
AI tool hooks (*for Claude Code*).

### 2. Check Status

```bash
ctx status
```

Shows context summary: files present, token estimate, and recent activity.

### 3. Start Using with AI

With Claude Code, context loads automatically via hooks. For other tools,
paste the output of:

```bash
ctx agent --budget 8000
```

### 4. Verify It Works

Ask your AI: **"Do you remember?"**

It should cite specific context: current tasks, recent decisions, 
or previous session topics.

## Common Workflows

### Track Context

```bash
# Add a task
ctx add task "Implement user authentication"

# Record a decision (full ADR fields required)
ctx add decision "Use PostgreSQL for primary database" \
  --context "Need a reliable database for production" \
  --rationale "PostgreSQL offers ACID compliance and JSON support" \
  --consequences "Team needs PostgreSQL training"

# Note a learning
ctx add learning "Mock functions must be hoisted in Jest" \
  --context "Tests failed with undefined mock errors" \
  --lesson "Jest hoists mock calls to top of file" \
  --application "Place jest.mock() before imports"

# Mark task complete
ctx complete "user auth"
```

### Check Context Health

```bash
# Detect stale paths, missing files, potential secrets
ctx drift

# See full context summary
ctx status
```

### Browse Session History

Export AI session transcripts to a browsable journal site:

```bash
# Export all sessions to .context/journal/
ctx recall export --all

# Generate and serve the journal site
ctx journal site --serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

To update the journal after new sessions, run the same two commands
again; `recall export` preserves existing YAML frontmatter and only
updates conversation content.

See [Session Journal](session-journal.md) for the full pipeline
including enrichment and normalization.

### Browse Session History

```bash
# List recent sessions
ctx recall list --limit 5

# Export sessions to browsable journal
ctx recall export --all
```

### Run an Autonomous Loop

Generate a script that iterates an AI agent until a completion
signal is detected:

```bash
ctx loop
chmod +x loop.sh
./loop.sh
```

See [Autonomous Loops](autonomous-loop.md) for configuration
and advanced usage.
