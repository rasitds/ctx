## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
- Git

### 1. Fork (or Clone) the Repository

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<you>/ctx.git
cd ctx

# Or, if you have push access:
git clone https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx.git
cd ctx
```

### 2. Build and Install the Binary

```bash
make build
sudo make install
```

This compiles the `ctx` binary and places it in `/usr/local/bin/`.

### 3. Install the Plugin from Your Local Clone

The repository ships a Claude Code plugin under `internal/assets/claude/`.
Point Claude Code at your local copy so that skills and hooks reflect
your working tree — no reinstall needed after edits:

1. Launch `claude`
2. Type `/plugin` and press Enter
3. Select **Marketplaces** → **Add Marketplace**
4. Enter the **absolute path** to the root of your clone,
   e.g. `~/WORKSPACE/ctx`
   (this is where `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lives — it points
   Claude Code to the actual plugin in `internal/assets/claude`)
5. Back in `/plugin`, select **Install** and choose `ctx`

!!! tip "Local Plugin = Live Edits"
    Because the marketplace points at a directory on disk, any change
    you make to a skill or hook under `internal/assets/claude/` takes
    effect the next time Claude Code loads it. No rebuild, no
    reinstall.

### 4. Verify

```bash
ctx --version       # binary is in PATH
claude /plugin list # plugin is installed
```

You should see the `ctx` plugin listed, sourced from your local path.

```

### Skills: Two Directories, One Rule

| Directory | What lives here | Distributed to users? |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/assets/claude/skills/` | The 25 `ctx-*` skills that ship with the plugin | Yes |
| `.claude/skills/` | Dev-only skills (release, QA, backup, etc.) | No |

**`internal/assets/claude/skills/`** is the single source of truth for
user-facing skills. If you are adding or modifying a `ctx-*` skill,
edit it there.

**`.claude/skills/`** holds skills that only make sense inside this
repository (release automation, QA checks, backup scripts). These are
never distributed to users.

## Day-to-Day Workflow

### Go Code Changes

After modifying Go source files, rebuild and reinstall:

```bash
make build && sudo make install
```

The `ctx` binary is statically compiled — there is no hot reload.
You must rebuild for Go changes to take effect.

### Skill or Hook Changes

Edit files under `internal/assets/claude/skills/` or
`internal/assets/claude/hooks/`.

After making changes, update the plugin version and refresh the marketplace:

1. Bump the version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
   (the `plugins[0].version` field)
2. Bump the version in `internal/assets/claude/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   (the top-level `version` field)
3. *(Optional but recommended)* Update `VERSION` to match —
   keeping all three in sync avoids confusion
4. In Claude Code, type `/plugin` and press Enter
5. Select **Marketplaces** → **activememory-ctx**
6. Select **Update marketplace**
7. Restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect

### Running Tests

```bash
make test            # fast: all tests
make audit           # full: fmt + vet + lint + drift + docs + test
make smoke           # build + run basic commands end-to-end
```

### Running the Docs Site Locally

```bash
make site-setup      # one-time: install zensical via pipx
make site-serve      # serve at localhost
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicating effort
2. For large changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Read the specs in `specs/` for design context

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Run `make audit` to catch issues early
4. Commit with a clear message (see below)
5. Push and open a pull request

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

Examples:

- `feat(cli): add ctx export command`
- `fix(drift): handle missing files gracefully`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

### Code Style

- Follow Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add tests for new functionality
- Handle errors explicitly
