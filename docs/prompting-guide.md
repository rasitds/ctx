## Prompting Guide

Effective prompts for working with AI assistants in ctx-enabled projects.

!!! tip Help Your AI Sidekick
    AI assistants *may not* automatically read context files.

    **The right prompt triggers the right behavior**. 

This guide documents prompts that reliably produce good results.

---

## Session Start

### "Do you remember?"

Triggers the AI to read `AGENT_PLAYBOOK`, `CONSTITUTION`, 
`sessions/`, and other context files before responding.

Use this during the start of every important session.

```
Do you remember what we were working on?
```

This question **implies** prior context exists. So, the AI checks files
rather than admitting ignorance.

### "What's the current state?"

Prompts reading of `TASKS.md`, recent sessions, and status overview.

Use this when resuming work after a break.

**Variants**:

* "Where did we leave off?"
* "What's in progress?"
* "Show me the open tasks"

---

## During Work

### "Why doesn't X work?"

This triggers **root cause analysis** rather than surface-level fixes.

Use this when something fails unexpectedly.

Framing as "*why*" encourages investigation before action. The AI will trace 
through code, check configurations, and identify the actual cause.

!!! example "Real Example"
    "Why can't I run /ctx-save?" led to discovering missing permissions
    in settings.local.json bootstrapping—a fix that benefited all users.

### "Is this consistent with our decisions?"

This prompts checking `DECISIONS.md` before implementing.

Use this before making architectural choices.

**Variants**:

* "Check if we've decided on this before"
* "Does this align with our conventions?"

### "What would break if we..."

This triggers **defensive thinking** and **impact analysis**.

Use this before making significant changes.

```
What would break if we change the Settings struct?
```

### "Before you start, read X"

This ensures specific context is loaded before work begins.

Use this when you know the relevant context exists in a specific file.

```
Before you start, read .context/sessions/2026-01-20-auth-discussion.md
```

## Reflection and Persistence

### "What did we learn?"

This prompts **reflection** on the session and often triggers adding
learnings to `LEARNINGS.md`.

Use this after completing a task or debugging session.

This is an **explicit reflection prompt**. The AI will summarize insights
and often offer to persist them.

### "Add this as a learning/decision"

This is an **explicit persistence request**.

Use this when you have discovered something worth remembering.

```
Add this as a learning: "JSON marshal escapes angle brackets by default"

# or simply.
Add this as a learning.
# and let the AI autonomously infer and summarize.
```

### "Save context before we end"

This triggers **context persistence** before the session closes.

Use it at the end of the session or before switching topics.

**Variants**:

- "Let's persist what we did"
- "Update the context files"
- `/ctx-save` (*slash command in Claude Code*)

---

## Exploration and Research

### "Explore the codebase for X"

This triggers thorough codebase search rather than guessing.

Use this when you need to understand how something works.

This works because "**Explore**" signals that **investigation is needed**, 
not immediate action.

### "How does X work in this codebase?"

This prompts reading actual code rather than explaining general concepts.

Use this to understand the existing implementation.

```
How does session saving work in this codebase?
```

### "Find all places where X"

This triggers a **comprehensive search** across the codebase.

Use this before refactoring or understanding the impact.

---

## Meta and Process

### "What should we document from this?"

This prompts identifying learnings, decisions, and conventions
worth persisting.

Use this after complex discussions or implementations.

### "Is this the right approach?"

This invites the AI to challenge the current direction.

Use this when you want a sanity check.

This works because it allows AI to disagree. 
AIs often default to agreeing; this prompt signals you want an 
**honest assessment**.

### "What am I missing?"

This prompts thinking about edge cases, overlooked requirements,
or unconsidered approaches.

Use this before finalizing a design or implementation.

## Anti-Patterns

Based on our `ctx` development experience (*i.e., "sipping our own champagne"*)
so far, here are some prompts that tend to produce poor results:

| Prompt                | Problem                       | Better Alternative                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| "Fix this"            | Too vague, may patch symptoms | "Why is this failing?"                |
| "Make it work"        | Encourages quick hacks        | "What's the right way to solve this?" |
| "Just do it"          | Skips planning                | "Plan this, then implement"           |
| "You should remember" | Confrontational               | "Do you remember?"                    |
| "Obviously..."        | Discourages questions         | State the requirement directly        |

## Quick Reference

| Goal            | Prompt                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Load context    | "Do you remember?"                       |
| Resume work     | "What's the current state?"              |
| Debug           | "Why doesn't X work?"                    |
| Validate        | "Is this consistent with our decisions?" |
| Impact analysis | "What would break if we..."              |
| Reflect         | "What did we learn?"                     |
| Persist         | "Add this as a learning"                 |
| Explore         | "How does X work in this codebase?"      |
| Sanity check    | "Is this the right approach?"            |
| Completeness    | "What am I missing?"                     |
