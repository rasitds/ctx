## The Problem

Context files contain project-specific decisions, learnings, conventions, and
tasks. By default, they live in `.context/` inside the project tree, and that
works well when the context can be public.

But sometimes you need the context *outside* the project:

* **Open-source projects with private context**: Your architectural notes,
  internal task lists, and scratchpad entries shouldn't ship with the public
  repo.
* **Compliance or IP concerns**: Context files reference sensitive design
  rationale that belongs in a separate access-controlled repository.
* **Personal preference**: You want a single context repo that covers
  multiple projects, or you just prefer keeping notes separate from code.

ctx supports this through three configuration methods. This recipe shows how
to set them up and how to tell your AI assistant where to find the context.

!!! tip "TL;DR"
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/repos/myproject-context && cd ~/repos/myproject-context && git init
    cd ~/repos/myproject
    ctx --context-dir ~/repos/myproject-context --allow-outside-cwd init
    ```
    Then create `.contextrc` in the project root:
    ```yaml
    context_dir: ~/repos/myproject-context
    allow_outside_cwd: true
    ```
    All `ctx` commands now use the external directory automatically.

## Commands and Skills Used

| Tool                  | Type         | Purpose                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `ctx init`            | CLI command  | Initialize context directory            |
| `--context-dir`       | Global flag  | Point ctx at a non-default directory    |
| `--allow-outside-cwd` | Global flag  | Permit context outside the project root |
| `.contextrc`          | Config file  | Persist the context directory setting   |
| `CTX_DIR`             | Env variable | Override context directory per-session  |
| `/ctx-status`         | Skill        | Verify context is loading correctly     |

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Create the Private Context Repo

Create a separate repository for your context files. This can live anywhere:
a private GitHub repo, a shared drive, a sibling directory:

```bash
# Create the context repo
mkdir ~/repos/myproject-context
cd ~/repos/myproject-context
git init
```

### Step 2: Initialize ctx Pointing at It

From your project root, initialize ctx with `--context-dir` pointing to the
external location. Because the directory is outside your project tree, you also
need `--allow-outside-cwd`:

```bash
cd ~/repos/myproject
ctx --context-dir ~/repos/myproject-context \
    --allow-outside-cwd \
    init
```

This creates the full `.context/`-style file set inside
`~/repos/myproject-context/` instead of `~/repos/myproject/.context/`.

!!! warning "Boundary Validation"
    `ctx` validates that the `.context` directory is within the current working
    directory. If your external directory is truly outside the project root,
    every `ctx` command needs `--allow-outside-cwd` — or persist the setting
    in `.contextrc` (*next step*).

### Step 3: Make It Stick

Typing `--context-dir` and `--allow-outside-cwd` on every command is tedious.
Pick one of these methods to make the configuration permanent.

#### Option A: `.contextrc` (*Recommended*)

Create a `.contextrc` file in your project root:

```yaml
# .contextrc — committed to the project repo
context_dir: ~/repos/myproject-context
allow_outside_cwd: true
```

ctx reads `.contextrc` automatically. Every command now uses the external
directory without extra flags:

```bash
ctx status          # reads from ~/repos/myproject-context
ctx add learning "Redis MULTI doesn't roll back on error"
```

!!! tip "Commit `.contextrc`"
    `.contextrc` belongs in the project repo. It contains no secrets — just a
    path and a boundary override. It lets teammates share the same configuration.

#### Option B: `CTX_DIR` Environment Variable

Good for CI pipelines, temporary overrides, or when you don't want to commit
a `.contextrc`:

```bash
# In your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc)
export CTX_DIR=~/repos/myproject-context
```

Or for a single session:

```bash
CTX_DIR=~/repos/myproject-context ctx status
```

#### Option C: Shell Alias

If you prefer a shell alias over `.contextrc`:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias ctx='ctx --context-dir ~/repos/myproject-context --allow-outside-cwd'
```

#### Priority Order

When multiple methods are set, `ctx` resolves the context directory in this
order (*highest priority first*):

1. `--context-dir` flag
2. `CTX_DIR` environment variable
3. `context_dir` in `.contextrc`
4. Default: `.context/`

### Step 4: Configure `CLAUDE.md` to Reference the External Context

When context lives outside the project tree, your AI assistant needs to know
where to find it. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` from the project root, so add
a pointer there:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Context Location

This project's context files live in a separate repository:
**~/repos/myproject-context/**

When using ctx commands, the `.contextrc` in this project root handles
the path automatically. To load context manually:

```bash
ctx agent --budget 4000 --context-dir ~/repos/myproject-context --allow-outside-cwd
```

Read the context files from that directory:
- `~/repos/myproject-context/TASKS.md`: current work items
- `~/repos/myproject-context/DECISIONS.md`: architectural decisions
- `~/repos/myproject-context/CONVENTIONS.md`: code patterns
- `~/repos/myproject-context/CONSTITUTION.md`: hard rules
```

For Claude Code hooks, update `.claude/settings.local.json` to pass the
external path:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "ctx agent --budget 4000 --session $PPID --context-dir ~/repos/myproject-context --allow-outside-cwd 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Share with Teammates

Teammates clone both repos and set up `.contextrc`:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone git@github.com:org/myproject.git
cd myproject

# Clone the private context repo
git clone git@github.com:org/myproject-context.git ~/repos/myproject-context
```

If `.contextrc` is already committed to the project, they're done — ctx
commands will find the external context automatically.

If teammates use different paths, each developer sets their own `CTX_DIR`:

```bash
export CTX_DIR=~/my-own-path/myproject-context
```

For scratchpad key distribution across the team, see the
[Syncing Scratchpad Notes](scratchpad-sync.md) recipe.

### Step 6: Day-to-Day Sync

The external context repo has its own git history. Treat it like any other
repo — commit and push after sessions:

```bash
cd ~/repos/myproject-context

# After a session
git add -A
git commit -m "Session: refactored auth module, added rate-limit learning"
git push
```

Your AI assistant can do this too. When ending a session:

```text
You: "Save what we learned and push the context repo."

Agent: [runs ctx add learning, then commits and pushes the context repo]
```

You can also set up a post-session habit: project code gets committed to the
project repo, context gets committed to the context repo.

## Conversational Approach

You don't need to remember the flags. Ask your assistant:

```text
You: "Set up ctx to use ~/repos/myproject-context as the context directory."

Agent: "I'll create a .contextrc in the project root pointing to that path.
       I'll also update CLAUDE.md so future sessions know where to find
       context. Want me to initialize the context files there too?"
```

```text
You: "My context is in a separate repo. Can you load it?"

Agent: [reads .contextrc, finds the path, loads context from the external dir]
       "Loaded. You have 3 pending tasks, last session was about the auth
       refactor."
```

## Tips

* **Start simple**. If you don't need external context yet, don't set it up.
  The default `.context/` in-tree is the easiest path. Move to an external
  repo when you have a concrete reason.
* **One context repo per project**. Sharing a single context directory across
  multiple projects creates confusion. Keep the mapping 1:1.
* **Use `.contextrc` over env vars** when the path is stable. It's committed,
  documented, and works for the whole team without per-developer shell setup.
* **Don't forget the boundary flag**. The most common error is
  `Error: context directory is outside the project root`. Set
  `allow_outside_cwd: true` in `.contextrc` or pass `--allow-outside-cwd`.
* **Commit both repos at session boundaries**. Context without code history
  (or code without context history) loses half the value.
