## Skills

Skills are slash commands that run **inside your AI assistant** (*e.g.,
`/ctx-next`*), as opposed to CLI commands that run in your terminal
(*e.g., `ctx status`*). 

Skills give your agent structured workflows: It knows what to read, what to 
run, and when to ask. Most wrap one or more `ctx` CLI commands with 
opinionated behavior on top. 

!!! tip "Skills Are Best Used Conversationally"
    The beauty of `ctx` is that it's designed to be intuitive and 
    conversational, allowing you to interact with your AI assistant 
    naturally. That's why you don't have to memorize many of
    these skills.

    See the [**Prompting Guide**](prompting-guide.md) for natural-language 
    triggers that invoke these skills conversationally.

    However, when you need a more precise control, you have the option
    to invoke the relevant skills directly.

## Session Lifecycle

Skills for starting, running, and ending a productive session.

!!! note "Session Ceremonies"
    Two skills in this group are **ceremony skills**: `/ctx-remember` (session
    start) and `/ctx-wrap-up` (session end). Unlike other skills that work
    conversationally, these should be invoked as **explicit slash commands**
    for completeness. See [Session Ceremonies](recipes/session-ceremonies.md).

### `/ctx-remember`

Recall project context and present a structured readback.
**Ceremony skill** — invoke explicitly at session start.

**Wraps**: `ctx agent --budget 4000`, `ctx recall list --limit 3`,
reads TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md, LEARNINGS.md

**See also**: [Session Ceremonies](recipes/session-ceremonies.md),
[The Complete Session](recipes/session-lifecycle.md)

---

### `/ctx-status`

Show context summary — files, token budget, tasks, recent activity —
with interpreted suggestions.

**Wraps**: `ctx status [--verbose] [--json]`

**See also**: [The Complete Session](recipes/session-lifecycle.md),
[`ctx status` CLI](cli-reference.md#ctx-status)

---

### `/ctx-agent`

Load the full context packet optimized for AI consumption.
Also runs automatically via the PreToolUse hook with cooldown.

### `/ctx-next`

Suggest 1-3 concrete next actions ranked by priority, momentum,
and unblocked status.

**Wraps**: reads TASKS.md, `ctx recall list --limit 3`

**See also**: [The Complete Session](recipes/session-lifecycle.md),
[Tracking Work Across Sessions](recipes/task-management.md)

---

### `/ctx-commit`

Commit code with integrated context persistence — pre-commit checks,
staged files, Co-Authored-By trailer, and a post-commit prompt to
capture decisions and learnings.

**Wraps**: `git add`, `git commit`, optionally chains to
`/ctx-add-decision` and `/ctx-add-learning`

**See also**: [The Complete Session](recipes/session-lifecycle.md)

---

### `/ctx-reflect`

Pause and reflect on session progress. Walks through a checklist of
learnings, decisions, task completions, and session notes to persist.

### `/ctx-wrap-up`

End-of-session context persistence ceremony. Gathers signal from
git diff, recent commits, and conversation themes. Proposes
candidates (learnings, decisions, conventions, tasks) with complete
structured fields for user approval, then persists via `ctx add`.
Offers `/ctx-commit` if uncommitted changes remain.
**Ceremony skill** — invoke explicitly at session end.

Consolidate redundant entries in LEARNINGS.md or DECISIONS.md. Groups
overlapping entries by keyword similarity, presents candidates, and —
with user approval — merges groups into denser combined entries.
Originals are archived, not deleted.

**Wraps**: reads LEARNINGS.md and DECISIONS.md, writes consolidated
entries, archives originals, runs `ctx reindex`

**See also**:
[Detecting and Fixing Drift](recipes/context-health.md)

**See also**:
[Detecting and Fixing Drift](recipes/context-health.md)

---

### `/check-links`

Scan all markdown files under `docs/` for broken links. Two passes:
internal links (verify file targets exist on disk) and external links
(HTTP HEAD with timeout, report failures as warnings). Also checks
image references.

Invoked automatically as check #12 during `/audit`.

**Wraps**: Glob + Grep to scan, `curl` for external checks

**See also**:
[`/audit`](#audit-related-skills)

---

### `/ctx-context-monitor`

Respond to context checkpoint signals when usage hits high thresholds.
Fires at adaptive intervals and offers context persistence before
the session ends.

**Type**: Automatic: Triggered by the `check-context-size` hook,
not user-invocable

[Running an Unattended AI Agent](recipes/autonomous-loops.md)

---

## Planning & Execution

Skills for structured implementation and parallel agent workflows.

### `/ctx-implement`

worktrees on dedicated branches, analyze task blast radius for
grouping, and tear down with merge.

**Wraps**: `git worktree add`, `git worktree list`,
`git worktree remove`, `git merge`

**See also**:
[Parallel Agent Development with Git Worktrees](recipes/parallel-worktrees.md)

## Project-Specific Skills

The ctx plugin ships the skills listed above.
Teams can add their own project-specific skills to `.claude/skills/` in the
project root — these are separate from plugin-shipped skills and are scoped
to the project.

Project-specific skills follow the same format and are invoked the same way.

Custom skills are not covered in this reference.
