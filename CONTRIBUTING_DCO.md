## Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## How to Sign Off

To sign off on a commit, add the `-s` flag to your git commit command:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will add a line like this to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Make sure your `user.name` and `user.email` are set in your git config:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Why DCO?

The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or
otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing. It provides
a clear record of contributions without requiring a more formal Contributor
License Agreement (CLA).
