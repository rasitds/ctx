# Implementation Plan

This file is the orchestrator's directive. The agent's actual tasks live in `.context/TASKS.md`.

## Current Directive

- [ ] Check `.context/TASKS.md` and work on the first unchecked item

## Completion Criteria

When `.context/TASKS.md` has no unchecked items remaining, the directive is complete.

## North Star (Endgame)

Before declaring DONE, consider these goals:

1. **Define your north star** — What does "done" look like for this project?
2. **Validate end-to-end** — Does the system work as intended?
3. **Document for others** — Can someone else pick this up?

---

## Notes

- Tasks belong in `.context/TASKS.md` (the agent's mind)
- This file provides meta-direction, not task details
- Update North Star goals as the project evolves
